0,"12 October, 2023 ","New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee","It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1,"11 October, 2023 ","IUML, which Rahul Gandhi called secular, extends support to Palestine even after Hamas beheads and rapes Israelis ","Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML).On Tuesday (10th October), the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) announced its support for Palestine while asserting that Israel’s ‘occupation’ of the state of Palestine is the main cause of the surging tensions in West Asia. In its resolution, IUML stated, “It is a hot reality that Israel’s occupation of Palestine is the root cause of the entire West Asian tensions.Moreover, the League claimed that Israel’s ‘encroachment’ of Khuds Mosque is “extremely unjustified”.Interestingly, while it was the Hamas terrorist organisation that launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians this week, the IUML asserted that Israel is “not just against Palestine but against the entire global human community.” The IUML termed the Israel-Hamas conflict as a human rights issue.Furthermore, the IUML urged the United Nations to bring up a peaceful solution to the ‘Palestinian issue’ adding that India has always stood with Palestine.The party offered its “strong support to the Palestinian people and also expressed its protest over the “unfair developments” in Palestine.It is worth noting that the IUML which is an offshoot of the Muslim League that played a significant role in the partition of India is an ally of the Congress party. While the IUML has links with Jammat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), both accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of spreading radicalism in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had called the IUML a ‘secular’ party.During his controversial US visit in June this year, Rahul Gandhi asserted that the Muslim League, a Muslim political party in India which played a vital role in the partition of India on religious lines, was “completely secular”. The interviewer asked him, “You talked about secularism and democracy while opposing the Hindu party BJP, however, the Congress in Kerala has been in alliance with the Muslim party, the Muslim League in Kerala, the state from which you were an MP”. To this, Rahul Gandhi said, “Muslim League is a completely secular party, there is nothing non-secular about the Muslim League. I think the person has not studied the Muslim League”.Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. While the IUML on its website claims that it is “uncompromisingly anchors the nationalist and secular principles”, the party’s activities have been in sharp contrast to this.The IUML backing Palestine is not surprising since a Muslim party’s leaders feel religiously obligated to stand with the Ummah. On 9th October, the Congress party passed a resolution backing the Palestinian people while raising concerns over the situation.“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop,” the Congress party said.Interestingly, the Congress party’s resolution did not even mention the words Hamas or Israel. Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in a conversation with IndiaToday said that “Hamas cannot be called a terrorist organisation”. He asserted that while the US has labelled Hamas as a terrorist organisation, the government of India has not made any such classification. Tharoor’s assertion comes even when Prime Minister Modi has explicitly termed the attacks on Israel as “terrorist attacks”.Tharoor says- ""Can't label Hamas as Terrorist Organisation"" pic.twitter.com/BDOgZNfXatPerhaps out of political imperative to avoid upsetting the ‘vote bank,’ the Congress party cannot comprehend that Hamas holding innocent Israeli people hostage, killing children and families, and raping numerous civilians is terrorism.The recent Israel-Hamas war began on Saturday (7th October) when the State of Israel was attacked by the Palestine-based Islamic terror group Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya commonly known as Hamas, resulting in the deaths of over 1000 Israelis. Nearly 2400 people have been wounded, with dozens are still being held captive by the Hamas terrorists.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, their apparent purpose was to celebrate and glorify the tragic murder of over 200 innocent Israelies.

It stated, “Celebrating mass murder is a deeply disturbing and irrational course of action, and it should not be permitted.”The Hindu Forum Canada announced that it will actively participate in pivotal unity rallies across Canada in collaboration with the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). “Our purpose is to demonstrate unwavering support for Israel, and in this endeavour, we stand united,” the Forum said.#BREAKING : Hindu Forum #Canada successfully mobilised the entire Indian community to participate in a powerful display of solidarity with ‘Canadian Jewish organizations’.

Both community members marched shoulder to shoulder as they unequivocally condemned terrorism. According to BNN Network, the protest was also organised to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict.Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow on 9th October released a statement saying that the rally organised in support of the terrorist organisation Hamas was an unsanctioned one and without a permit.Chow “unequivocally” denounced the rally and said that the Chief of Police has assured her that they will investigate the matter and address any suspected incidents of hate.Meanwhile, Canada’s Minister of Finance, Chrystia Freeland expressed support for the pro-Israel demonstrations. “We are in solidarity with you,” she reportedly said.The joint protests by Indians and Jews in Canada are significant for more reasons than one. Canada was recently in the headlines after the House of Commons gave a standing ovation to a former Nazi war criminal Yaroslav Hunka, who was posted in the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”.The incident opened the pandora’s box what with Canada’s history of sheltering Ukrainian nationalists who worked for Hitler’s Nazi army in the second world war. Notably, Chrystia Freeland’s grandfather, too, worked for a Nazi newspaper which was recruited for the Galicia Division of the Waffen-SS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

6,"6 October, 2023 ",The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation,"Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

7,"4 October, 2023 ","From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game","No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,"2 October, 2023 ","Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar","While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

9,"1 October, 2023 ",Ramesh Bidhuri and his comments: Here is why politicians are not demanding the repeal of the Colonial ‘Parliamentary Privilege’ rule,"The concept of parliamentary privilege finds its origins in the House of Commons of Britain. In the 17th-century case known as 'R vs. Elliot, Holles, and Valentine,' Sir John Elliot, a member of the House of Commons, faced arrest for uttering seditious words during a debate and for engaging in violence against the Speaker. However, the House of Lords granted immunity to Sir JohnErnest J. Gaines, an American author once said, “Why is it that, as a culture, we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands?” When Ramesh Bidhuri, Delhi BJP MP called a BSP MP Danish Ali “Katwe (circumcised)”, “Bhadwe (Pimp), and Ugrawadi (Terrorist)”, it looked like an Indian holding a gun against another Indian. Just after the viral video floated on social media, there was a hue and cry over this statement against a Muslim legislator. The Opposition immediately called for action against the BJP MP and requested Lok Sabha Speaker to suspend the leader. While just a day before, India was celebrating the Women’s Reservation Bill, the statement by a BJP MP changed the narrative and everyone started discussing hate speech in India. Communal comments are not new here and such a language coming from dignified legislators has been unfortunately common.In the past nine years, India has witnessed opposition leaders like Mani Shankar Aiyyar calling PM Modi as “Maut Ka Saudagar”, Mallikarjun Kharge calling PM as “Ravan”, and TMC MP Mahua Moitra calling TDP MP Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu as “Harami”. The best part about this game of slurs is that the Constitution itself gives protection to the MPs. Under Article 105 of the Constitution, Members of Parliament are exempted from any legal action for any statement made or act done in the course of their duties inside the Parliament. A defamation suit cannot be filed for a statement made in the House. It is due to this privilege, that Rakhi Birla, an MLA from Delhi enjoyed the protection of the law when she called Union Home Minister Amit Shah “Tadipar”. Similarly, one observes that the strong language used by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for PM Modi like “Anpadh, Gawar” is used only in the Delhi Legislative Assembly and not outside. The video clips of the speeches are then shared across all the social media platforms and reach out to the general public, who might wonder about the ‘dignity’ of these legislators.Mark Twain once said, “There are lies, damned lies and statistics”. Politicians across the globe lie but those lies should not cover up the reality of a nation especially if the lie is spoken to appease a community and to hide a gruesome truth. Just after the movie “The Kashmir Files” which talked about the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits was released, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal not only mocked the makers of the movie but also denied the genocide using the words “Jhoothi Film”. While the words were used for a movie, it was derogatory and full of hatred for Kashmiri Pandits. Earlier, he had openly abused leaders like Nitin Gadkari, Bikram Singh Majithia, Kapil Sibal, and Arun Jaitley and later wrote an apology letter, requesting to take back the defamation cases filed against him.If strict action should be taken against Ramesh Bidhuri, then similar action should be taken against Udyanidhi Stalin for his comments on eradicating Sanatan Dharma. Calling a religion “HIV”, “AIDS”, “Dengue” and “Malaria” is not only disrespectful but also violates the fundamental rights of citizens. A citizen, including legislators, have the fundamental right to speech but also a fundamental right to propagate and worship their religion. Rights must be quantified with duties. The concept of parliamentary privilege finds its origins in the House of Commons of Britain. In the 17th-century case known as ‘R vs. Elliot, Holles, and Valentine,’ Sir John Elliot, a member of the House of Commons, faced arrest for uttering seditious words during a debate and for engaging in violence against the Speaker. However, the House of Lords granted immunity to Sir John, asserting that words spoken within Parliament should be subject to judgment only within the parliamentary context. This privilege was subsequently codified in the Bill of Rights of 1689, a pivotal moment in which the Parliament of England firmly established the principles of constitutional monarchy. Considering that the Modi Government has already taken steps to repeal various laws from the British colonial era, it raises the question of whether amendments should also be made to Article 105. The opposition leaders will never ask for repealing the privilege law because they know the moment, they open their mouths; they will abuse Modi and Hindu Dharma. “Charity Begins at Home” is a famous saying. The I.N.D.I.A bloc should come forward and request the NDA Government to repeal this law in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament and suggest stricter laws against Hate Speech.(This article has been co-authored by Aditya Trivedi, an Advocate at Delhi High Court and Ritwik Mehta, a policy consultant and Founder of Niti Tantra)Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

10,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

11,"25 September, 2023 ",‘Kapil Dev kidnapped or Harsh Bhogle-type promotional stunt?’ See how Netizens react to a viral video showing goons taking him away,"As soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir's timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha BhogleOn Monday, September 25, a 0.07-second video clip took the internet by storm. The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

12,"24 September, 2023 ",Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’,"In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis. Hi Kirti, amusing to see that you,Bhagwat Jha Azad’s son,can’t distinguish between the hinterlands of #WestBengal & #UttarPradesh!This is clip of a jihadi attack engineered by TMC on me on Election Day, April 30 2021.Having become a FAMILY DOORMAT you have lost your rationality! https://t.co/qfkH1XGlV4In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government in the nation that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

13,"23 September, 2023 ",Politicians and activists spread fake news by Indian Express claiming that a Dalit ration shopkeeper is facing discrimination in Gujarat: Here are the facts,"There is no truth in the allegations that villagers are not buying from the shop because it is run by a Dalit. They were buying from the same shop earlier but stopped later due to unavailability of adequate stock and the shopkeeper's threat of case under SC-ST Act after arguments It is being claimed in the media and social media that there has been caste discrimination against a Dalit shopkeeper in a village in Gujarat. It is being told that in the Kanosan village of Saraswati taluka of Patan district, people refused to take grains from the ration shop run by a Dalit man and then the collector transferred their ration cards to the shop in a nearby village. However, the entire claim is false and misleading.This whole matter is being given the angle of Savarna versus Dalit. Many posts about this were also seen on social media. Dilip Mandal shared an article in ‘The Indian Express’ and wrote, “Those who cannot buy ration from Dalit shopkeepers, how will they make a Hindu nation? They can not even make a Hindu village.”ये बनाएंगे हिंदू राष्ट्र? ये? दलित दुकानदार से राशन नहीं ख़रीद सकते। ये बनाएँगे? इनसे एक हिंदू गाँव नहीं बन पाएगा। https://t.co/hSIrAuznp2Apart from this, many such posts were seen. Hitendra Pithadiya, who heads the Scheduled Caste cell of the Congress and has been in controversy for spreading fake news in the past, quoted The Indian Express report and wrote, ‘This is a Hindu Rashtra, which follows the Gujarat model of hatred, violence and discrimination’. He further claimed that all the villagers were Hindus and that they collectively boycotted a Dalit shopkeeper running a ration shop. He then made other comments asking who gave the collector the power to pass this order and why the collector was promoting casteism.This is Hindu Rashtra for you on the pattern of the Gujarat Model of hatred, violence, and discrimination. The residents are all Hindus who have boycotted the Dalit Shopkeeper who runs the FPS of the village. Overall Caste Hindus have a superiority complex, and they are… https://t.co/3nFDP49tpQThere were also some media reports in which the issue has been given a Dalit versus Savarna angle. The Telangana Today report, titled ‘In Modi’s Gujarat, officials openly support casteism against Dalit’, begins with a question that read, “Is the government machinery in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home State of Gujarat openly supporting casteism by validating the economic boycott of a Dalit by ‘upper caste’ villagers?”The report further quoted “reports from Ahmedabad” as saying that the Patan district collector has advised 436 ration card holders of Kanosan village in Saraswati taluka to purchase ration from nearby Endla village so that they do not have to buy grains from a rationing shop run by a Dalit man in the village. It was also written that most of the ration card holders, who belong to the Thakor community, had stopped buying grains from the cheap grain shops of Dalits for the last 18 months. Citing reports, it was said that two years ago, the controversy started when the shopkeeper refused to give food grains to a Thakor.Taking forward the narrative of Savarna versus Dalits, the report highlights how alleged “atrocities” against Dalits are on the rise in Modi’s Gujarat. The same was reinforced by citing an RTI reply. Nowhere in the report does the villagers mention why they boycotted the shopkeeper.Some reports were also seen in the Gujarati media. News18 Gujarati’s report begins with this – “Caste discrimination is allegedly seen in many areas even today. Recently, the case of Kanosan village in Saraswati taluka of Patan district has come to light”, it said. It added, “The villagers did not take rations from the ration shop operated by a Dalit. In the midst of this situation, the Patan district collector transferred all the 436 ration card holders of the village to the adjoining village Adla.” The report also said that the village is dominated by the Thakor community. TV9 Gujarati also reported with the headline ‘Kanosan village of Patan in disputes regarding caste discrimination’.All these social media posts and reports are based on a report by The Indian Express, which was published on September 21, 2023. The headline of this report is misleading, which strengthened the narrative of Savarna against Dalits. The headline is – “In Gujarat, villagers won’t buy ration from Dalit’s shop, collector transfers all cards to nearby village”. (Archive link) But this report itself shows that there is nothing like casteism and the villagers stopped buying grains because they were not getting enough food grains.The Indian Express report quoted the collector’s order according to which the villagers alleged that they were not getting food grains on time and that the quantity of food grains fixed by the government during the time of Corona pandemic was also not being given in adequate quantity. When villagers complained to shopkeeper Kanti Parmar, he threatened to implicate them by filing a case under the ST/SC Act. He eventually complained to the local administration.The same report also quoted statements from shopkeeper Kanti Parmar and some villagers. According to this, the villagers accused Kanti Parmar of filing a false case and said that this was the reason why they did not go to his ration shop to buy the food grains. Kanti, on the other hand, denied the allegations.“After receiving complaints from the villagers that they were not getting enough food grains from the ration shop and the shopkeeper was threatening to trap them, we demanded that the ration card be transferred to a nearby village,” said the village sarpanch.To resolve the dispute, the district administration had recorded statements of a total of 268 ration card holders in the village, out of which 260 had sought permission to purchase ration from a neighbouring village. In March, the mamlatdar of Saraswati village had also held a meeting with the villagers and a similar demand was made in it. Subsequently, the district collector issued an order allowing 436 ration card holders of the village to purchase ration from nearby Endla village.Divya Bhaskar’s report says that this dispute between the ration card holders and the shopkeeper has been going on for the last two years. Police cases have also been filed against each other in the same controversy. The controversy started over the allotment of quantity of foodgrains received as per the rule. The report also said that when customers raised their voices over enough food grains, the shopkeeper threatened to implicate them by filing a case under the ST/SC Act. Due to this, consumers started buying grains from nearby villages. The dispute eventually reached Gandhinagar. After this, the collector transferred the ration card holders to the nearby village so that the dispute did not escalate further and no untoward incident took place in the village.Therefore, there is no truth in the allegations that villagers are not buying from the shop because it is run by a Dalit. They were buying from the same shop earlier but stopped later due to the unavailability of adequate stock and the shopkeeper’s threat of case.It has also been clarified by the Food and Civil Supplies Department of the Government of Gujarat that the decision to transfer the cards of the ration card holders of Kanosan village is not the result of any caste discrimination. A statement about The Indian Express report said that on August 21, 2021, the villagers lodged a complaint alleging that the shopkeeper was not giving enough food grains and misbehaving. The complaints were then found to be genuine when the matter was investigated by the mamlatdar of Saraswati taluka. On the other hand, fed up with the shopkeeper’s behaviour, ration card holders started buying food grains from other places.“After extensive scrutiny, inconsistency and discrepancy in the stock of the shop were found, resulting in the seizure of material worth Rs 51,397 and transfer of ration card holders to nearby Endla village to address the concerns of the consumers,” it added.Denying the allegations of any kind of discrimination against the shopkeeper, the state government said that the action was taken not as a result of any kind of discrimination but in response to a complaint filed against the shopkeeper. The purpose of shifting cardholders who buy food grains from ration shops to nearby villages was to ensure that they get an adequate quantity of food grains on time and that the loopholes identified during the investigation could be removed.OpIndia also tried to contact the District Supply Officer of Patan to get more information on the matter, but no contact could be established.

In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

This is Left Media! pic.twitter.com/SBduohHT95Syzmon Thomas posted, “Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt. I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

16,"10 October, 2023 ","Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory","Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,"9 October, 2023 ","Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

19,"4 October, 2023 ","Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers","In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

20,"4 October, 2023 ",Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms,"To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. That Kalaadnya’s Sayali and Nrityankur’s Arundhati through Anandotsav have taken it upon themselves to realise the aspirations of young and bright Bharatanatyam performers assures that the best of Indian culture is nowhere nearly lost and there’s surely more to come.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

21,"27 September, 2023 ",When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule,"Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

But we can't stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed"", the CIJA had shared on the Parliament's celebration of a Nazi criminal. On 24th September, Canadian Parliament speaker Anthony Rota apologised for celebrating a Nazi, Yaroslav Hunka, who had participated in the genocide against Jews during World War II. In his statement, Rota claimed that he was made aware of more information on Hunka that “caused” him to regret the decision to celebrate him. Furthermore, he claimed no one in the Parliament or among the Ukrainian delegation was aware of his intentions to celebrate Hunka during his address.On September 22, in the House of Commons, I recognized an individual in the gallery. I regret my decision to do so, and accept full responsibility for my actions. Read my statement here: https://t.co/Hd9chtHFNJHe said, “On Friday, 22nd September, in my remarks following the address of the President of Ukraine, I recognised an individual in the gallery. I have subsequently become aware of more information, which causes me to regret my decision to do so. I wish to make clear that no one, including fellow parliamentarians and the Ukraine delegation, was aware of my intention or of my remarks before I delivered them. This initiative was entirely my own, the individual in question being from my riding and having been brought to my attention. I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Earlier, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs expressed their concerns over the matter. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), they said, “We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. Canada’s Jewish community stands firmly with #Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. But we can’t stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed.”We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. #Canada's Jewish community stands…Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Official Opposition since 2022, has also raised objections to celebrating Hunka in the Parliament. He pointed out that Trudeau personally met and honoured Hunka. Accusing the ruling party of recognising a Nazi veteran on the floor of the House of Commons, he demanded an apology from the PM.It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division).Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognized on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the… https://t.co/9JFUEqsdW8He said, “It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division). Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognised on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the Ukrainian President. This is an appalling error in judgment on the part of Justin Trudeau, whose personal protocol office is responsible for arranging and vetting all guests and programming for state visits of this kind. No parliamentarians (other than Justin Trudeau) had the opportunity to vet this individual’s past before he was introduced and honoured on the floor of the House of Commons. Without warning or context, it was impossible for any parliamentarian in the room (other than Mr Trudeau) to know of this dark past. Mr. Trudeau must personally apologise and avoid passing the blame to others as he always does.”On 22nd September, the Canadian House of Commons gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a World War II veteran who fought for “Ukrainian independence” against Russian aggressors. This is how the speaker of the House, Anthony Rota, introduced him. The 98-year-old war veteran, however, was a member of a SS unit, the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”, established in 1943 by the Nazis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also present during the occasion. Notably, SS was the main paramilitary group under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany and was primarily responsible for tunning Holocaust operations. 14th SS-Volunteer Division Galicia was made up of volunteers, which means that Yaroslav Hunka joined the unit on his own will, and was not conscripted.The members of the First Ukrainian Division have been deemed war criminals by several experts. However, Canadian inquiry into their history did not recognise them as war criminals. Interestingly, there is clear evidence that Canada housed at least 3,000 war criminals. Canadian authorities established a commission to look into war criminals, and the commission headed by Justice Jules Deschenes submitted its report in December 1986 titled “Commission of Inquiry on War Crimes“. As per the report, the Canadian government had allowed over 2,000 war criminals from WWII to enter Canada despite the Canadian Jewish Congress’s opposition. The commission gave Hunko’s division “clean chit” due to the lack of evidence. 2014 Nazi Hunter Steve Rambam called Canada a safe haven for war criminals. Notably, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also called out Canada in a recent statement for giving shelter to terrorists and gangsters.

Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands. A detailed report of this incident can be read here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

24,"9 October, 2023 ","Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power","After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,"9 October, 2023 ","As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip","Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,"8 October, 2023 ","‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra","Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar. At the same time, PSI Anirudh Kamaliya clarified, “An investigation is currently underway to find out whether Nilesh Parmar was involved in the Manjusar incident. However, Nilesh Parmar has been sent to Sabarmati jail under PASA after his name cropped up in complaints against both sides and his name cropped up in more than three similar offences.”On Thursday (28th September), there was an incident of stone pelting during Ganesh Visarjan at Manjusar in Savli taluka of Vadodara. In this incident, some Hindus were injured and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also broken. In this case, the police have registered an FIR against 18 people and the mob of the remaining 30 unidentified people and further investigation is underway. On the other hand, it has been learned through reports that 5 accused of stone-pelting have also been arrested.वडोदरा के मुंजसर मैं गणेश विसर्जन पर कल किए गए पथराव की तस्वीरें आयी सामने.पथराव करने वाले फ़िलहाल गाँव छोड़कर भाग निकले.पुलिस ने फ़िलहाल पाँच लोगो को पकड़ा है बाक़ियो को ढूँढा जा रहा है. https://t.co/y7GpjqiOup pic.twitter.com/GHJFnblQCpThe incident took place in Manjusar village of Savli. Videos of this incident have also surfaced on social media. In these videos, it is seen that miscreants wearing face masks threw stones from the roofs of the houses. Islamic posters were also put up in the building from where the stones were thrown. It is learnt that the stone pelters are currently absconding and efforts are on to trace them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

27,"12 October, 2023 ","New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee","It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

28,"11 October, 2023 ","IUML, which Rahul Gandhi called secular, extends support to Palestine even after Hamas beheads and rapes Israelis ","Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML).On Tuesday (10th October), the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) announced its support for Palestine while asserting that Israel’s ‘occupation’ of the state of Palestine is the main cause of the surging tensions in West Asia. In its resolution, IUML stated, “It is a hot reality that Israel’s occupation of Palestine is the root cause of the entire West Asian tensions.Moreover, the League claimed that Israel’s ‘encroachment’ of Khuds Mosque is “extremely unjustified”.Interestingly, while it was the Hamas terrorist organisation that launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians this week, the IUML asserted that Israel is “not just against Palestine but against the entire global human community.” The IUML termed the Israel-Hamas conflict as a human rights issue.Furthermore, the IUML urged the United Nations to bring up a peaceful solution to the ‘Palestinian issue’ adding that India has always stood with Palestine.The party offered its “strong support to the Palestinian people and also expressed its protest over the “unfair developments” in Palestine.It is worth noting that the IUML which is an offshoot of the Muslim League that played a significant role in the partition of India is an ally of the Congress party. While the IUML has links with Jammat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), both accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of spreading radicalism in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had called the IUML a ‘secular’ party.During his controversial US visit in June this year, Rahul Gandhi asserted that the Muslim League, a Muslim political party in India which played a vital role in the partition of India on religious lines, was “completely secular”. The interviewer asked him, “You talked about secularism and democracy while opposing the Hindu party BJP, however, the Congress in Kerala has been in alliance with the Muslim party, the Muslim League in Kerala, the state from which you were an MP”. To this, Rahul Gandhi said, “Muslim League is a completely secular party, there is nothing non-secular about the Muslim League. I think the person has not studied the Muslim League”.Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. While the IUML on its website claims that it is “uncompromisingly anchors the nationalist and secular principles”, the party’s activities have been in sharp contrast to this.The IUML backing Palestine is not surprising since a Muslim party’s leaders feel religiously obligated to stand with the Ummah. On 9th October, the Congress party passed a resolution backing the Palestinian people while raising concerns over the situation.“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop,” the Congress party said.Interestingly, the Congress party’s resolution did not even mention the words Hamas or Israel. Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in a conversation with IndiaToday said that “Hamas cannot be called a terrorist organisation”. He asserted that while the US has labelled Hamas as a terrorist organisation, the government of India has not made any such classification. Tharoor’s assertion comes even when Prime Minister Modi has explicitly termed the attacks on Israel as “terrorist attacks”.Tharoor says- ""Can't label Hamas as Terrorist Organisation"" pic.twitter.com/BDOgZNfXatPerhaps out of political imperative to avoid upsetting the ‘vote bank,’ the Congress party cannot comprehend that Hamas holding innocent Israeli people hostage, killing children and families, and raping numerous civilians is terrorism.The recent Israel-Hamas war began on Saturday (7th October) when the State of Israel was attacked by the Palestine-based Islamic terror group Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya commonly known as Hamas, resulting in the deaths of over 1000 Israelis. Nearly 2400 people have been wounded, with dozens are still being held captive by the Hamas terrorists.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, their apparent purpose was to celebrate and glorify the tragic murder of over 200 innocent Israelies.

It stated, “Celebrating mass murder is a deeply disturbing and irrational course of action, and it should not be permitted.”The Hindu Forum Canada announced that it will actively participate in pivotal unity rallies across Canada in collaboration with the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). “Our purpose is to demonstrate unwavering support for Israel, and in this endeavour, we stand united,” the Forum said.#BREAKING : Hindu Forum #Canada successfully mobilised the entire Indian community to participate in a powerful display of solidarity with ‘Canadian Jewish organizations’.

Both community members marched shoulder to shoulder as they unequivocally condemned terrorism. According to BNN Network, the protest was also organised to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict.Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow on 9th October released a statement saying that the rally organised in support of the terrorist organisation Hamas was an unsanctioned one and without a permit.Chow “unequivocally” denounced the rally and said that the Chief of Police has assured her that they will investigate the matter and address any suspected incidents of hate.Meanwhile, Canada’s Minister of Finance, Chrystia Freeland expressed support for the pro-Israel demonstrations. “We are in solidarity with you,” she reportedly said.The joint protests by Indians and Jews in Canada are significant for more reasons than one. Canada was recently in the headlines after the House of Commons gave a standing ovation to a former Nazi war criminal Yaroslav Hunka, who was posted in the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”.The incident opened the pandora’s box what with Canada’s history of sheltering Ukrainian nationalists who worked for Hitler’s Nazi army in the second world war. Notably, Chrystia Freeland’s grandfather, too, worked for a Nazi newspaper which was recruited for the Galicia Division of the Waffen-SS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,"10 October, 2023 ","There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

33,"6 October, 2023 ",The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation,"Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

34,"4 October, 2023 ","From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game","No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,"2 October, 2023 ","Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar","While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,"1 October, 2023 ",Ramesh Bidhuri and his comments: Here is why politicians are not demanding the repeal of the Colonial ‘Parliamentary Privilege’ rule,"The concept of parliamentary privilege finds its origins in the House of Commons of Britain. In the 17th-century case known as 'R vs. Elliot, Holles, and Valentine,' Sir John Elliot, a member of the House of Commons, faced arrest for uttering seditious words during a debate and for engaging in violence against the Speaker. However, the House of Lords granted immunity to Sir JohnErnest J. Gaines, an American author once said, “Why is it that, as a culture, we are more comfortable seeing two men holding guns than holding hands?” When Ramesh Bidhuri, Delhi BJP MP called a BSP MP Danish Ali “Katwe (circumcised)”, “Bhadwe (Pimp), and Ugrawadi (Terrorist)”, it looked like an Indian holding a gun against another Indian. Just after the viral video floated on social media, there was a hue and cry over this statement against a Muslim legislator. The Opposition immediately called for action against the BJP MP and requested Lok Sabha Speaker to suspend the leader. While just a day before, India was celebrating the Women’s Reservation Bill, the statement by a BJP MP changed the narrative and everyone started discussing hate speech in India. Communal comments are not new here and such a language coming from dignified legislators has been unfortunately common.In the past nine years, India has witnessed opposition leaders like Mani Shankar Aiyyar calling PM Modi as “Maut Ka Saudagar”, Mallikarjun Kharge calling PM as “Ravan”, and TMC MP Mahua Moitra calling TDP MP Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu as “Harami”. The best part about this game of slurs is that the Constitution itself gives protection to the MPs. Under Article 105 of the Constitution, Members of Parliament are exempted from any legal action for any statement made or act done in the course of their duties inside the Parliament. A defamation suit cannot be filed for a statement made in the House. It is due to this privilege, that Rakhi Birla, an MLA from Delhi enjoyed the protection of the law when she called Union Home Minister Amit Shah “Tadipar”. Similarly, one observes that the strong language used by Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal for PM Modi like “Anpadh, Gawar” is used only in the Delhi Legislative Assembly and not outside. The video clips of the speeches are then shared across all the social media platforms and reach out to the general public, who might wonder about the ‘dignity’ of these legislators.Mark Twain once said, “There are lies, damned lies and statistics”. Politicians across the globe lie but those lies should not cover up the reality of a nation especially if the lie is spoken to appease a community and to hide a gruesome truth. Just after the movie “The Kashmir Files” which talked about the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits was released, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal not only mocked the makers of the movie but also denied the genocide using the words “Jhoothi Film”. While the words were used for a movie, it was derogatory and full of hatred for Kashmiri Pandits. Earlier, he had openly abused leaders like Nitin Gadkari, Bikram Singh Majithia, Kapil Sibal, and Arun Jaitley and later wrote an apology letter, requesting to take back the defamation cases filed against him.If strict action should be taken against Ramesh Bidhuri, then similar action should be taken against Udyanidhi Stalin for his comments on eradicating Sanatan Dharma. Calling a religion “HIV”, “AIDS”, “Dengue” and “Malaria” is not only disrespectful but also violates the fundamental rights of citizens. A citizen, including legislators, have the fundamental right to speech but also a fundamental right to propagate and worship their religion. Rights must be quantified with duties. The concept of parliamentary privilege finds its origins in the House of Commons of Britain. In the 17th-century case known as ‘R vs. Elliot, Holles, and Valentine,’ Sir John Elliot, a member of the House of Commons, faced arrest for uttering seditious words during a debate and for engaging in violence against the Speaker. However, the House of Lords granted immunity to Sir John, asserting that words spoken within Parliament should be subject to judgment only within the parliamentary context. This privilege was subsequently codified in the Bill of Rights of 1689, a pivotal moment in which the Parliament of England firmly established the principles of constitutional monarchy. Considering that the Modi Government has already taken steps to repeal various laws from the British colonial era, it raises the question of whether amendments should also be made to Article 105. The opposition leaders will never ask for repealing the privilege law because they know the moment, they open their mouths; they will abuse Modi and Hindu Dharma. “Charity Begins at Home” is a famous saying. The I.N.D.I.A bloc should come forward and request the NDA Government to repeal this law in the upcoming winter session of the Parliament and suggest stricter laws against Hate Speech.(This article has been co-authored by Aditya Trivedi, an Advocate at Delhi High Court and Ritwik Mehta, a policy consultant and Founder of Niti Tantra)Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

37,"7 October, 2023 ",Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

38,"25 September, 2023 ",‘Kapil Dev kidnapped or Harsh Bhogle-type promotional stunt?’ See how Netizens react to a viral video showing goons taking him away,"As soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir's timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha BhogleOn Monday, September 25, a 0.07-second video clip took the internet by storm. The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

39,"24 September, 2023 ",Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’,"In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis. Hi Kirti, amusing to see that you,Bhagwat Jha Azad’s son,can’t distinguish between the hinterlands of #WestBengal & #UttarPradesh!This is clip of a jihadi attack engineered by TMC on me on Election Day, April 30 2021.Having become a FAMILY DOORMAT you have lost your rationality! https://t.co/qfkH1XGlV4In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government in the nation that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

40,"23 September, 2023 ",Politicians and activists spread fake news by Indian Express claiming that a Dalit ration shopkeeper is facing discrimination in Gujarat: Here are the facts,"There is no truth in the allegations that villagers are not buying from the shop because it is run by a Dalit. They were buying from the same shop earlier but stopped later due to unavailability of adequate stock and the shopkeeper's threat of case under SC-ST Act after arguments It is being claimed in the media and social media that there has been caste discrimination against a Dalit shopkeeper in a village in Gujarat. It is being told that in the Kanosan village of Saraswati taluka of Patan district, people refused to take grains from the ration shop run by a Dalit man and then the collector transferred their ration cards to the shop in a nearby village. However, the entire claim is false and misleading.This whole matter is being given the angle of Savarna versus Dalit. Many posts about this were also seen on social media. Dilip Mandal shared an article in ‘The Indian Express’ and wrote, “Those who cannot buy ration from Dalit shopkeepers, how will they make a Hindu nation? They can not even make a Hindu village.”ये बनाएंगे हिंदू राष्ट्र? ये? दलित दुकानदार से राशन नहीं ख़रीद सकते। ये बनाएँगे? इनसे एक हिंदू गाँव नहीं बन पाएगा। https://t.co/hSIrAuznp2Apart from this, many such posts were seen. Hitendra Pithadiya, who heads the Scheduled Caste cell of the Congress and has been in controversy for spreading fake news in the past, quoted The Indian Express report and wrote, ‘This is a Hindu Rashtra, which follows the Gujarat model of hatred, violence and discrimination’. He further claimed that all the villagers were Hindus and that they collectively boycotted a Dalit shopkeeper running a ration shop. He then made other comments asking who gave the collector the power to pass this order and why the collector was promoting casteism.This is Hindu Rashtra for you on the pattern of the Gujarat Model of hatred, violence, and discrimination. The residents are all Hindus who have boycotted the Dalit Shopkeeper who runs the FPS of the village. Overall Caste Hindus have a superiority complex, and they are… https://t.co/3nFDP49tpQThere were also some media reports in which the issue has been given a Dalit versus Savarna angle. The Telangana Today report, titled ‘In Modi’s Gujarat, officials openly support casteism against Dalit’, begins with a question that read, “Is the government machinery in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home State of Gujarat openly supporting casteism by validating the economic boycott of a Dalit by ‘upper caste’ villagers?”The report further quoted “reports from Ahmedabad” as saying that the Patan district collector has advised 436 ration card holders of Kanosan village in Saraswati taluka to purchase ration from nearby Endla village so that they do not have to buy grains from a rationing shop run by a Dalit man in the village. It was also written that most of the ration card holders, who belong to the Thakor community, had stopped buying grains from the cheap grain shops of Dalits for the last 18 months. Citing reports, it was said that two years ago, the controversy started when the shopkeeper refused to give food grains to a Thakor.Taking forward the narrative of Savarna versus Dalits, the report highlights how alleged “atrocities” against Dalits are on the rise in Modi’s Gujarat. The same was reinforced by citing an RTI reply. Nowhere in the report does the villagers mention why they boycotted the shopkeeper.Some reports were also seen in the Gujarati media. News18 Gujarati’s report begins with this – “Caste discrimination is allegedly seen in many areas even today. Recently, the case of Kanosan village in Saraswati taluka of Patan district has come to light”, it said. It added, “The villagers did not take rations from the ration shop operated by a Dalit. In the midst of this situation, the Patan district collector transferred all the 436 ration card holders of the village to the adjoining village Adla.” The report also said that the village is dominated by the Thakor community. TV9 Gujarati also reported with the headline ‘Kanosan village of Patan in disputes regarding caste discrimination’.All these social media posts and reports are based on a report by The Indian Express, which was published on September 21, 2023. The headline of this report is misleading, which strengthened the narrative of Savarna against Dalits. The headline is – “In Gujarat, villagers won’t buy ration from Dalit’s shop, collector transfers all cards to nearby village”. (Archive link) But this report itself shows that there is nothing like casteism and the villagers stopped buying grains because they were not getting enough food grains.The Indian Express report quoted the collector’s order according to which the villagers alleged that they were not getting food grains on time and that the quantity of food grains fixed by the government during the time of Corona pandemic was also not being given in adequate quantity. When villagers complained to shopkeeper Kanti Parmar, he threatened to implicate them by filing a case under the ST/SC Act. He eventually complained to the local administration.The same report also quoted statements from shopkeeper Kanti Parmar and some villagers. According to this, the villagers accused Kanti Parmar of filing a false case and said that this was the reason why they did not go to his ration shop to buy the food grains. Kanti, on the other hand, denied the allegations.“After receiving complaints from the villagers that they were not getting enough food grains from the ration shop and the shopkeeper was threatening to trap them, we demanded that the ration card be transferred to a nearby village,” said the village sarpanch.To resolve the dispute, the district administration had recorded statements of a total of 268 ration card holders in the village, out of which 260 had sought permission to purchase ration from a neighbouring village. In March, the mamlatdar of Saraswati village had also held a meeting with the villagers and a similar demand was made in it. Subsequently, the district collector issued an order allowing 436 ration card holders of the village to purchase ration from nearby Endla village.Divya Bhaskar’s report says that this dispute between the ration card holders and the shopkeeper has been going on for the last two years. Police cases have also been filed against each other in the same controversy. The controversy started over the allotment of quantity of foodgrains received as per the rule. The report also said that when customers raised their voices over enough food grains, the shopkeeper threatened to implicate them by filing a case under the ST/SC Act. Due to this, consumers started buying grains from nearby villages. The dispute eventually reached Gandhinagar. After this, the collector transferred the ration card holders to the nearby village so that the dispute did not escalate further and no untoward incident took place in the village.Therefore, there is no truth in the allegations that villagers are not buying from the shop because it is run by a Dalit. They were buying from the same shop earlier but stopped later due to the unavailability of adequate stock and the shopkeeper’s threat of case.It has also been clarified by the Food and Civil Supplies Department of the Government of Gujarat that the decision to transfer the cards of the ration card holders of Kanosan village is not the result of any caste discrimination. A statement about The Indian Express report said that on August 21, 2021, the villagers lodged a complaint alleging that the shopkeeper was not giving enough food grains and misbehaving. The complaints were then found to be genuine when the matter was investigated by the mamlatdar of Saraswati taluka. On the other hand, fed up with the shopkeeper’s behaviour, ration card holders started buying food grains from other places.“After extensive scrutiny, inconsistency and discrepancy in the stock of the shop were found, resulting in the seizure of material worth Rs 51,397 and transfer of ration card holders to nearby Endla village to address the concerns of the consumers,” it added.Denying the allegations of any kind of discrimination against the shopkeeper, the state government said that the action was taken not as a result of any kind of discrimination but in response to a complaint filed against the shopkeeper. The purpose of shifting cardholders who buy food grains from ration shops to nearby villages was to ensure that they get an adequate quantity of food grains on time and that the loopholes identified during the investigation could be removed.OpIndia also tried to contact the District Supply Officer of Patan to get more information on the matter, but no contact could be established. The report will be updated once a response is received.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

43,"10 October, 2023 ","Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory","Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

44,"9 October, 2023 ","Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

46,"4 October, 2023 ","Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers","In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

47,"4 October, 2023 ",Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms,"To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. That Kalaadnya’s Sayali and Nrityankur’s Arundhati through Anandotsav have taken it upon themselves to realise the aspirations of young and bright Bharatanatyam performers assures that the best of Indian culture is nowhere nearly lost and there’s surely more to come.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

48,"27 September, 2023 ",When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule,"Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

But we can't stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed"", the CIJA had shared on the Parliament's celebration of a Nazi criminal. On 24th September, Canadian Parliament speaker Anthony Rota apologised for celebrating a Nazi, Yaroslav Hunka, who had participated in the genocide against Jews during World War II. In his statement, Rota claimed that he was made aware of more information on Hunka that “caused” him to regret the decision to celebrate him. Furthermore, he claimed no one in the Parliament or among the Ukrainian delegation was aware of his intentions to celebrate Hunka during his address.On September 22, in the House of Commons, I recognized an individual in the gallery. I regret my decision to do so, and accept full responsibility for my actions.

I have subsequently become aware of more information, which causes me to regret my decision to do so. I wish to make clear that no one, including fellow parliamentarians and the Ukraine delegation, was aware of my intention or of my remarks before I delivered them. This initiative was entirely my own, the individual in question being from my riding and having been brought to my attention. I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Earlier, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs expressed their concerns over the matter. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), they said, “We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament.

This is an appalling error in judgment on the part of Justin Trudeau, whose personal protocol office is responsible for arranging and vetting all guests and programming for state visits of this kind. No parliamentarians (other than Justin Trudeau) had the opportunity to vet this individual’s past before he was introduced and honoured on the floor of the House of Commons. Without warning or context, it was impossible for any parliamentarian in the room (other than Mr Trudeau) to know of this dark past. Mr. Trudeau must personally apologise and avoid passing the blame to others as he always does.”On 22nd September, the Canadian House of Commons gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a World War II veteran who fought for “Ukrainian independence” against Russian aggressors. This is how the speaker of the House, Anthony Rota, introduced him. The 98-year-old war veteran, however, was a member of a SS unit, the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”, established in 1943 by the Nazis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also present during the occasion. Notably, SS was the main paramilitary group under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany and was primarily responsible for tunning Holocaust operations. 14th SS-Volunteer Division Galicia was made up of volunteers, which means that Yaroslav Hunka joined the unit on his own will, and was not conscripted.The members of the First Ukrainian Division have been deemed war criminals by several experts. However, Canadian inquiry into their history did not recognise them as war criminals. Interestingly, there is clear evidence that Canada housed at least 3,000 war criminals. Canadian authorities established a commission to look into war criminals, and the commission headed by Justice Jules Deschenes submitted its report in December 1986 titled “Commission of Inquiry on War Crimes“. As per the report, the Canadian government had allowed over 2,000 war criminals from WWII to enter Canada despite the Canadian Jewish Congress’s opposition. The commission gave Hunko’s division “clean chit” due to the lack of evidence. 2014 Nazi Hunter Steve Rambam called Canada a safe haven for war criminals. Notably, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also called out Canada in a recent statement for giving shelter to terrorists and gangsters.

50,"11 October, 2023 ","Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar","During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands.

51,"9 October, 2023 ","Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power","After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,"9 October, 2023 ","As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip","Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,"8 October, 2023 ","‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra","Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar. At the same time, PSI Anirudh Kamaliya clarified, “An investigation is currently underway to find out whether Nilesh Parmar was involved in the Manjusar incident. However, Nilesh Parmar has been sent to Sabarmati jail under PASA after his name cropped up in complaints against both sides and his name cropped up in more than three similar offences.”On Thursday (28th September), there was an incident of stone pelting during Ganesh Visarjan at Manjusar in Savli taluka of Vadodara. In this incident, some Hindus were injured and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also broken. In this case, the police have registered an FIR against 18 people and the mob of the remaining 30 unidentified people and further investigation is underway. On the other hand, it has been learned through reports that 5 accused of stone-pelting have also been arrested.वडोदरा के मुंजसर मैं गणेश विसर्जन पर कल किए गए पथराव की तस्वीरें आयी सामने.पथराव करने वाले फ़िलहाल गाँव छोड़कर भाग निकले.पुलिस ने फ़िलहाल पाँच लोगो को पकड़ा है बाक़ियो को ढूँढा जा रहा है. https://t.co/y7GpjqiOup pic.twitter.com/GHJFnblQCpThe incident took place in Manjusar village of Savli. Videos of this incident have also surfaced on social media. In these videos, it is seen that miscreants wearing face masks threw stones from the roofs of the houses. Islamic posters were also put up in the building from where the stones were thrown. It is learnt that the stone pelters are currently absconding and efforts are on to trace them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

54,"12 October, 2023 ","There is ISIS connection to the Hamas terror attack on Israel, we have evidence: Israeli ambassador to India Naor Gilon","""And we also found flags of Daesh with the equipment of the Hamas people who were under attackers. So there is an ISIS Daesh. We call it connection here..."" Naor Gilon said.On possible involvement of Islamic State in the Hamas attack on Israel, the Ambassador of Israel to India, Naor Gilon has said that as the terrorist group continues to kill innocent civilians mercilessly, this is exactly Daesh.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Gilon said, “Yeah, we are looking into it…We have evidence for that. It’s not only the mode of operation, as I said…decapitating, killing people in terrible ways, torturing whole families without any mercy, without any thinking. This is exactly Daesh.”“And we also found flags of Daesh with the equipment of the Hamas people who were under attackers. So there is an ISIS Daesh. We call it connection here…” he said.Notably, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi formed the Islamic State, also known as Daesh, with its origins in Iraq and Syria in 1999. It rose to prominence in 2014 when it seized sizable regions in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq.Speaking further on how the Israel-Hamas war will be a game-changer for the Middle East, the envoy said that all the negative forces in the Middle East are trying to destabilise the region.“I think if people understand what happened here, this is a game changer to the Middle East. It’s not about Israel…it’s not only about Israel. Of course, we are the victims here. ISIS is involved, Iran is involved. All the negative forces in the Middle East that were trying to destabilize the Middle East are now part of the reasons. I believe that the motivations they had here, they saw that the Middle East is going in a good direction. Three years ago, after the Abraham Accords, gulf countries getting closer to Israel,” he said.He also talked at length on I2U2 which is a grouping of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.“I2U2 is an economic forum coming out of its whole, cooperation started. India was very much involved. India is also involved in the idea of creating transportation and communication and connection between India and the Mediterranean through the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Israel. So all of that, these people didn’t want it to happen and they didn’t want Israel and Saudi Arabia to get closer. How far will we go in understanding that a huge change to the Middle East? I think we will go very far because if not, it will harm all the moderate regimes in the Middle East,” the envoy told ANI.I2U2 is also referred to as the West Asian Quad aimed to encourage joint investments between the member states in six mutually identified areas – water, energy, transportation, space, health and Food security.Meanwhile, Naor Gilon, as he talked further, argued that terrorism is terrorism, and attempting to provide context aims to portray the victims as oppressors.Expressing his concerns, Gilon said, “I see it very bad for two reasons. First…I saw some people across the world trying to give it context. There is no context to killing 1,200 people. More than 1000 civilians. Decapitating, raping, and whatnot. There is no context to that. Because if you try to do that, but,…you try to justify terror. You are a supporter of terror if you do that”.He also pointed out that the approaches of Israel and India are similar with regard to terrorism.“Our approach, also of India and all peace-seeking countries is that terror is terror. It can’t be justified, don’t put the context, don’t blame me…you turn the victim into the one who committed the crime,” he added.Gilon also raised concerns that Hamas might try to present themselves as ‘victims’ and use civilians as ‘human shields’.“Now, what will happen next is Hamas crying we are the victims, and you will see human shields, and probably…people abducted from Israel as human shields also. This is going to be very complicated,” Gilon said.The death toll in Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7 has jumped to 1,300 and some 3300 have been injured, including 28 in critical condition and 350 in serious condition, The Times of Israel reported.The fate of an estimated 150 people abducted and taken to the Gaza Strip during the attack by Hamas is still unclear, the report said.Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military has so far notified families of 97 hostages who were being held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, The Times of Israel reported. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

55,"12 October, 2023 ","London: Ex-Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone pleads guilty of tax fraud, receives suspended sentence of 17 months","Bernie Ecclestone was accused of failing to disclose more than £400 million (around 650 million US dollars at the time) in foreign assets to the government of the United Kingdom.Bernie Ecclestone, the former head of Formula One, admitted guilt to the charge of fraud and was given a 17-month suspended jail term. He was accused of failing to disclose more than £400 million (around 650 million US dollars at the time) in foreign assets to the government of the United Kingdom. He altered his plea at a case management hearing on 12 October at Southwark Crown Court after initially challenging the allegations at an earlier hearing in August. His trial was scheduled to begin in November.He consented to a legal settlement for 652.6 million pounds (803 million dollars) regarding money owed to the British tax authority over an 18-year period. He was sentenced to a 17-month prison term with a two-year suspension as well as ordered to pay £74,000 in prosecution fees. The court of Judge Justice Bryan recognised the ‘undeniable seriousness of his offence’ but noted that he had also taken into account the defendant’s age, his health and the potential effects of a prison sentence on his small kid. The judge instructed the 92-year-old to stand up when he handed down the punishment. When questioned if he comprehended the sentence, he responded, “I do.”The judge ruled, “Your offending is so serious that neither a fine nor a community order would be appropriate. It is rightly acknowledged that the custody threshold has been passed.” He mentioned the issues in the case for which the offender would be sentenced and noted, “Towards the end of the meeting you were asked if, since the conclusion of the previous investigation in 2008, and excluding the trusts referred to so far in the course of the meeting, whether you were linked as a settlor or beneficiary to any other trust in or outside of the United Kingdom.”He further continued, “You replied ‘no’. That was a lie. You were in fact linked to a trust structure known as the ‘Kinan Trust’ and another known as the ‘Nanki Trust’. I also bear in mind, as the prosecution has made clear before me, that the prosecution is very mindful, and has kept under careful review, the public interest in bringing and continuing these proceedings given your age and health.”The court observed, “The prosecution has borne in mind the report of the cardiologist Professor Knight and the evidence given by him to this court as to your health and the risks that would be presented by a trial.” In response to the civil settlement amount reached with HMRC, the judge stressed, “I accept that this settlement reflects a determination and demonstration of steps taken on your part to address your offending subject to this indictment and also reflects remorse on your part for your offending.”He was implored for a remark as he exited the court and he smiled and nodded but his response was garbled as he went into the rear of a white Range Rover. He entered the courtroom dressed in a grey three-piece suit and declared to the judge, “I plead guilty.” One of the most well-known figures in international motorsport, the billionaire oversaw Formula One from the late 1970s until January 2017. During that time, he tightened control over the commercial and sporting aspects of the company while growing Formula One into a valuable global media asset.America’s Liberty Media purchased it in 2017 from the previous private equity proprietor CVC. After he was ousted as Formula One’s supremo, Liberty set out to regain the interest of younger viewers. One of their efforts was the production of the popular Netflix documentary Drive to Survive which they did after his reign’s last months witnessed a decline in viewership.He was charged with fraud by false representation when it was claimed he neglected to disclose the existence of a Singaporean trust. According to the accusation, he deceptively told HMRC in July 2015 that he had only created one single trust on behalf of his children.The charge, per the prosecutor, Richard Wright KC was connected to a meeting between him and tax officials on 7 July 2015. He told the court that the businessman should have clarified that he was unable to answer when asked if he had any connections to further trusts “in or outside the UK” but instead chose to respond “no” considering that he was unaware of the reality of the situation.He conveyed, “The funds held there were very substantial and the annual losses and gains were tens and millions of United States dollars. Mr Ecclestone accepts that his answer ‘no’ was misleading.” He emphasised that he was “seeking to a draw a line under investigations into his tax affairs” and added that “He was fed up of paying huge bills for advice.” Christine Montgomery KC, his attorney notified the judge that his defendant “bitterly regrets the events that led to this criminal trial.” Bernie Ecclestone’s wife Fabiana, a vice-president of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the organisation that governs motorsports and a member of the FIA International Motorsport Council has previously attended court with him. He has a little boy named Ace and three grown-up daughters named Deborah, Tamara and Petra.Simon York, the director of the tax authority’s fraud investigation service, announced the accusation in July and highlighted that it came after a “complex and global criminal investigation.” He pronounced in July, “HMRC is on the side of honest taxpayers and we will take tough action wherever we suspect tax fraud. Our message is clear, no one is beyond our reach.”His public comments in recent years praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and supporting him in response to the invasion of Ukraine, particularly last year when he proclaimed that he would “take a bullet” for the Russian leader have gained traction. Formula One dissociated itself from the statements and stressed that they did not reflect the organisation’s viewpoints. He also expressed regret and apologised later.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

56,"12 October, 2023 ","IIT-B professor equates vegetarians with “militants”, blames casteism for food choices of Hindus","IIT Bombay professor Suryakant Waghmare blamed upper caste Hindus for ""militant vegetarianism"" Professor of sociology at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) Suryakant Waghmare has equated vegetarians with “militants” (terrorists) amid the controversy over separate tables for vegetarians at the institute.Written by a Sociology teacher at IIT Bombay: ‘Disgust against beef is display of hegemony of vegetarianism’Never before have I seen such disgusting justification of cow slaughter, which is not only inhuman but also has been a symbol of Hindu hate for centuries. As per this… pic.twitter.com/95smfYxUrMIn an opinion piece published in The Indian Express, Waghmare typically blamed the Hindu, more so the upper caste Hindu, for “militant vegetarianism” whose followers “seek to continually sustain the traditional ethics and aesthetics of segregation and hierarchy in food consumption”.He even blamed such vegetarians, who he has implied are upper-caste Hindus, for citing environmental concerns as the reason for being vegetarians.And yet, the IIT-B professor was careful enough to not offend vegans as he wrote, “Unlike veganism, which may emerge from compassion, the foundations of militant vegetarianism lie in varnashrama dharma and graded inequality”.Like every true Hindu-hating left-liberal, Waghmare did not fail to enlist “outcastes”, Christians, and Muslims as the victims of “militant vegetarians”. And naturally, the professor threw in the term “cow nationalism” to say that “the hegemony of vegetarianism over the last century has institutionalised disgust against beef eaters”.On 1st October, the mess councils along with the Wardens and Associate Wardens of three hostels of IIT-Bombay imposed a fine of ₹10000 on an unnamed student for creating chaos and flouting mess rules.The development came three days after the said student, along with 2-3 others, deliberately ate non-vegetarian food in a reserved vegetarian section of the mess on September 28, 2023.It must be mentioned that only 6 out of 129 tables in the dining area were reserved for vegetarian students while the remaining could be utilised by both vegetarian and non-vegetarian students.The decision was not taken by the administration of IIT-Bombay but by the students’ councils of Hostel 12, 13 and 14 along with elected representatives.In Hinduism (or Sanatana Dharma), vegetarianism is associated with faith. Moreover, consuming cow meat which is beef is considered a sin because the cow is considered an all-loving mother of humans, animals, and nature alike.Furthermore, Jainism also prohibits meat consumption from the point of view that no living being should be harmed, let alone murdered, and there must be peaceful co-existence among all beings.And yet, Islamists, leftists, liberals, and other Abrahamic religions like Christians too have not only been critical of Hindus for being vegetarians but have committed crimes to violate their faith.In July this year, former chairperson of Infosys Foundation, Sudha Murthy was subjected to ridicule after she revealed in an interview that she carries her own bag of food and cooking items when travelling abroad because she is a vegetarian.Casteist remarks were hurled at the author by Hindu-hating leftists on X, formerly Twitter.On 7th September, a Dalit girl was force-fed beef by two Muslim men named Shoaib and Nadeem and spiked cold drinks were forced down her throat. After intoxicating the victim, the accused gang-raped her and recorded the barbaric act on video. A third accused named, Shifat Ansari, a girl, was also named.In a case from the Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a Muslim man, Ahmed Sharif, disguised as a Hindu under the false name Ajay Singh, entrapped a Hindu woman and married her. The woman was pressured to convert and consume beef.In May, a Muslim man named Ismail Yusuf was arrested in Surat, Gujarat for selling samosas stuffed with beef.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

57,"12 October, 2023 ","Bihar: Madarsa teacher booked for raping a minor girl several times, Panchayat called to ‘settle’ the matter, money offered to withdraw case","According to the victim's mother, Tariq, Mumtaz, Anjar, Shamsher, Munna, Chhotkan and others were in attendance in the panchayat that gathered to shield the accused.In the Saharsa district of Bihar, a Madarsa teacher named Mohammad Imtiyaz alias Chunna was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl several times. The victim’s mother had lodged a complaint against the accused on 8th October. Accused Imtiyaz’s crime came to light after the minor victim got pregnant. While the accused has been arrested, the victim is undergoing treatment at a hospital after her child was aborted.A panchayat was called by some people belonging to the Muslim community to ‘settle’ the matter. The victim’s mother alleged that accused Mohammad Imtiyaz had threatened to kill the victim if she informed anyone about his crime. She claimed that after she filed a complaint against the accused and an FIR was registered at the Sadar Thana police station, a panchayat was called and the victim was offered Rs 10,000 to withdraw the case.According to the victim’s mother, Tariq, Mumtaz, Anjar, Shamsher, Munna, Chhotkan and others were in attendance in the panchayat that gathered to shield the accused. Tariq is stated to be the Ward Commissioner (Ward Councillor) among these persons involved in pressuring the victim’s family to ‘compromise’. Moreover, they suggested that the victim should take abortion medications. Notably, a POCSO Act case has been filed against the accused.In the complaint, the victim’s mother explained that she and her husband lived in Delhi. They had left the girl at her grandmother’s house so she could attend the madarsa and continue her education. However, Imtiyaz sexually abused her for months.The victim’s grandmother said, “Imtiaz from the madrasa was doing wrong things with my granddaughter. He would threaten her with violence if she ever spoke out, which is why she couldn’t tell anyone. She started experiencing abdominal pain and had a high fever, so she was prescribed medication. When she didn’t improve, we took her to a private hospital, where we found out that the madrasa Hafiz Mohammad Imtiyaz had been sexually abusing her. Doctors operated to remove the fetus to save the girl’s life.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Citing Syria’s state television, Reuters reported that Israel launched attacks on the main airports in the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo on Thursday.As per Syrian local channel Sham FM, Syrian air defences were launched in response to both attacks. Citing local reports, Arab News said that the attacks were “simultaneous” and they “damaged landing strips in the two airports, putting them out of service.” The Israeli military has not made any comments on this.No one was injured in the attacks, state news agency SANA said, quoting an unnamed military source.Israel keeps hitting targets in Syria, including the Damascus and Aleppo airports, as Syria is used to route weapons to Hamas, Hezbollah and other Palestinian terror groups. Iran is known to have used Syria to send support to Hamas. It has been reported that Israel targeted the airports to disrupt Iranian supplies to Syria.  In the meanwhile, there are claims on social media that Israel struck the airports just before an Iranian flight carrying weapons was to land at Damascus.#BREAKING Israel conducts simultaneous air strikes on #Damascus & #Aleppo International Airports, blocking oncoming Iranian flights that contain smuggled weapons for Iran’s proxies on Israel’s borders.It has been claimed that an Airbus 340 flight from Tehran to Damascus was carrying Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, several commanders of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and tons of anti-tank missiles for Hezbollah. As the airport was bombed, the flight had to return, as per the claims.BREAKING:The Airbus A340 carrying the Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister about to land in Damascus also had several commanders of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps on board and several tons of anti-tank missiles for Hezbollah.Israel bombed the airport pic.twitter.com/ZwmEJ5uGAtBREAKING:The Israel Air Force struck Damascus International Airport in Syria just minutes a plane with Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on board.

59,"12 October, 2023 ","Gujarat: Unidentified miscreants pelt stones at Shiva temple; uproot and throw saffron flag in the drain, investigation underway","The priest of the temple told OpIndia how such incidents occur every year when Navrati is around the corner and urged the authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly.
A Hindu temple has been vandalized in Umreth, the taluka seat of Gujarat’s Anand district, a few days before the auspicious annual 9-day long Hindu festival Navratri commences on October 15. The incident reportedly took place late at night on Wednesday, October 11, when some unidentified miscreants tore and threw the saffron flag installed in the temple and also tried to damage the Shivling placed in the temple’s sanctum sanctorum and the Nandi idol placed outside.The incident reportedly occurred at the Shree Siddhnath Mahadev temple which is situated on the banks of a lake near Odd Bazar, located in Anand’s Umreth. This is the same area where recently, a Muslim mob stormed the Chandramaulishwar Mahadev temple and nearby areas with swords and sticks after an argument broke out between Hindus and Muslims over the molestation of minor Hindu girls by Muslim youths.Meanwhile, in yesterday’s incident, some unidentified miscreants hurled stones at the Shree Siddhnath Mahadev temple and vandalised the saffron flag placed there. They also tried to damage the idols of Nandi and the Shivling, but they failed in their attempts, as the iron gates of the sanctum sanctorum in which the Shivling is placed were locked and the Nandi idol, though placed outside in the open, is made of stone hence it could not be damaged.The incident came to the fore when the following morning, on Thursday, October 12, the temple priest and a few worshippers arrived at the temple. They saw that the safforn flag placed on top of the temple was missing and there were stones and bricks thrown inside the temple premises. Upon searching, the devotees found the safforn flag thrown in a nearby drain, after which they informed the police.Some videos have been circulating on social media, in which stones and bricks are seen scattered around the temple.આણંદના ઉમરેઠમાં એક શિવમંદિર પર હુમલાની ઘટના સામે આવી– પ્રાચીન સિદ્ધનાથ મહાદેવ મંદિર પર મોટા મોટા પથ્થરો ફેંકાયા, નંદી મહારાજની મૂર્તિ ખંડિત– સ્થાનિકોનો દાવો, ભગવાનની મૂર્તિ ખંડિત કરવાનો પણ થયો પ્રયાસ– ભગવા ધ્વજને નાળામાં ફેંકી દેવાયો – પુજારીની ફરિયાદ બાદ પોલીસ અજ્ઞાત… pic.twitter.com/ExXqtc73JRSince the incident failed to grab mainstream media attention, OpIndia contacted local sources to delve into the details of the incident. We were told that a similar incident had occurred there a few years ago, due to which fencing was erected around the temple. We were also told that every night, until around 11 p.m., local Hindu youths keep sitting around the temple premises, which is why the miscreants chose to attack the temple around midnight.The local Hindus accused some local Muslim youths of being behind the incident. They alleged that four youths were involved in the vandalism, however, they could not be identified.OpIndia also spoke to the temple priest who confirmed that the safforn flag was placed in the temple only three or four days back. He added that the miscreants pulled down the saffron flag that was placed on the back gate of the temple and threw it in the drain. He also revealed how he saw stones and bricks scattered around the temple premises.He revealed that there is the dargah of Jorawar Pir Bawa just 200 meters away from the temple. Further, calling it a matter that needs to be investigated thoroughly, he lamented how such incidents occur every year when Navrati is around the corner. OpIndia spoke to PSI Ghanshyamsinh Pavara of Umreth Police Station who said that the police found stones and bricks lying outside the temple. While, in the viral video, one can clearly see small pieces of stone lying outside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, which possibly got stuck to the mesh fence placed outside, the PSI said, “We feel that this is the work of drunken people as there is no stone pelting in the sanctum sanctorum or any attempt to damage the temple.” Nobody has been named as of yet. An investigation is being conducted.”On Sunday, June 6, around midnight, a Muslim mob with weapons stormed the roads of Umreth and held the entire area hostage. The incident took place two days after the molestation of 2 Hindu minors by Muslim youths in the area.According to reports, there was a dispute between the Hindu-Muslim community in Umreth, the taluka headquarters of Anand district, over the molestation of two Hindu minor girls, and around Sunday night, a Muslim mob stormed the area near the Chandramuleshwar Mahadev temple with swords and sticks, creating an atmosphere of fear in Umreth.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

62,"12 October, 2023 ",AIMPLB and Asaduddin Owaisi say Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli civilians is Israel’s fault,"PM Modi has categorically condemned the attack on Israel as a ""terrorist act"". At least 1,200 people died in Israel in the terrorist attack by Hamas.Four days after students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) took out a protest march in support of Hamas terrorists, other representatives of the Muslim community in India have also started supporting the global Ummah.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has reportedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “siding with oppressors instead of with the oppressed” after PM Modi’s statement condemning the terror attack.In a statement released by AIMPLB President Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, the body held Israel responsible for the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October which made Israel retaliate.Maulana Rahmani also justified the act of terror by Hamas which killed at least 1,200 people. “To call this reaction terrorism is to strengthen the oppressors, and is injustice to the victims,” the AIMPLB statement reads.Meanwhile, the chief of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has been backing Palestine and Hamas during the conflict. On 11th October, Asaduddin Owaisi shared a photo of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote, “Hands of GAZA, Falasteen Zindabad. Violence Murdabaad (done mainly by Israel or any Group/organisation).

The AIMPLB, too, said that India has always held the stand that Israel should listen to UN’s calls.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor too drew flak for refusing to call Hamas as a terrorist group while appearing on national television. Tharoor was called out by the former envoy of Israel to India Daniel Carmon.However, notably, PM Modi has categorically condemned the attack on Israel as a “terrorist act”.

63,"12 October, 2023 ",Old news of Congress leader getting arrested and lashed in Saudi viral again: Here is how he got into trouble for holding Bharat Jodo poster in front of Kaaba,"In January, the youth Congress leader shared his picture where he, in a show of allegiance to the Gandhi scion, posed with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during the Haj pilgrimage. He was soon arrested and thrown in jail by the Saudi police.On Thursday, October 12, an 8-month-old picture of a youth Congress leader Raza Kadri holding a placard to support Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Joda Yatra in front of Kaaba in Mecca went viral on social media. The old viral picture resurfaced after the Congress leader, after spending 8 months in Saudi Arabia jail, returned to India last week.Several social media users shared the old picture of the Congress youth leader on X, formally Twitter, with assertions that he was jailed and received 99 lashes from the Saudi authorities as punishment for insulting the Kaaba.Congress leader Raja Kadri got a two-month sentence and received 99 lashes as punishment for insulting Kaba with a Congress poster.Requesting Congress atleast give him MLA ticket😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/BZQNQA9wif⚡Congress Leader ""Raja Kadri"" displayed a poster of the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during Haj pilgrimage.Later he was arrested and put behind bars by Saudi Authorities and got two-month sentence and 99 lashes as punishment. He just completed his imprisonment and released. pic.twitter.com/mWkAkc75w9In January this year, the youth Congress leader Raza Kadri, a resident of Niwari district near Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh, shared his picture where he, in a show of allegiance to the Gandhi scion, posed with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during the Haj pilgrimage. In the picture, the Congress leader stood with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in his hand against the backdrop of the Kaaba, the Islamic shrine located near the centre of the Great Mosque in Mecca and considered by Muslims everywhere to be the most sacred spot on Earth.Notably, displaying any type of flag or placard is unlawful action in Saudi Arabia including at Islamic holy sites. The Indian Consulate has time and again advised its citizens to comply with the rules. For obvious reasons, Kadri’s public display of loyalty towards his boss did not sit well with the Saudi authorities. Two days after the picture of Raza Kadri surfaced on social media, the Saudi police hunted him down at the hotel where he was staying along with other pilgrims of Madhya Pradesh; promptly arrested and put him behind bars, where he was subjected to an eight-month sentence and received 99 lashes as punishment.On October 4, 2023, the youth Congress leader returned to India after he was released from the Saudi jail. Now following his release and return to India, his old picture has resurfaced on social media.After returning, the youth Congress leader, in an interview with the Hindi daily Bhaskar, shared his harrowing experience in the Saudi jail. He revealed how he was kept in a dark and dingy room and not allowed to sleep for the first two months in jail. He was given only 2 pieces of bread to eat for lunch and dinner and was not allowed to speak to his family back in India.The Congress leader recounted how he was tricked by the Saudi police and arrested from his hotel at around 2 a.m. in the night on January 26, 2023. The police covered his face with a black mask handcuffed him and brought him to the police station. He was told that he had flouted Saudi Arabia’s rules which is why he was arrested.After arrest, he was thrown into the Dhahban Central Prison also known as Dhahban Prison, a maximum security prison facility located near Dahaban, Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. For the next two months, he was kept in a dark room and interrogated every day. Further recounting the torture he went through the Congress leader said that the Saudi police used a lie detector machine to verify every answer he gave to them. Before going through the lie detector test he was fed some liquid which made him very drowsy, however, he was not allowed to sleep. The authorities used to throw water on him to keep him awake. He added that he was confined to that dark gloomy chamber in Dhahban Central Prison for six months. Neither did he see the sunlight nor the face of a single human being. After experiencing a mental breakdown, he was sent to a psychotherapist who incidentally was an Indian.The doctor advised the jail superintendent to transfer him to a normal jail. To his luck, the jailer took the advice and after two days he was transferred to a normal jail, where he recalled his condition was no better. Indian housed in that jail were discriminated against, Raza Kadri revealed, adding that they were provided insects and bug-infested blankets and beddings and served food in areas which were dirty.Finally, on October 2, the Congress leader was released from jail and he returned to India on October 4, 2023. Recounting the torture he was subjected to by Saudi Arabia authorities, the Congress leader said, “yahan aakar aisa laga ki jahannam aisa hi hota hoga” (once I came back I realised this is how hell must be like).The Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi’s brainchild, began on September 7, 2022, in Kanyakumari and concluded on January 30, 2023, in Kashmir’s Srinagar. It began at a time when Congress was facing dissent, resignations, internal tussle, and so on. All in all, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra was more of a vanity project launched in a desperate attempt to revive the grand old party and moreover relaunch the Gandhi scion.All the PR and marketing of the supposed foot march was all for nothing as it turned out that the Gandhi scion along with his team was rallying with 59 luxury containers equipped with beds, attached bathrooms, air-conditioners, couches, mini conference halls and what have you. The entire fiasco cost nearly Rs 300 crore.It had several controversies to its credit, details of which can be read here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

64,"12 October, 2023 ","New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee","It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The order dated March 15 is modified to that extent. The appeal is allowed in part.”According to a March 2021 trial court verdict, the case qualified for the death penalty at the maximum level because it was counted in the rarest of the rare category. The High Court had reserved its decision in August following the hearing from the Delhi Police and the perpetrator’s attorneys.A team of Delhi Police officers, some without weapons conducted a raid at Batla House on 19 September 2000 in order to apprehend Indian Mujahideen terrorists. The serial blasts that occurred at several locations in Delhi which resulted in at least 30 fatalities a week earlier were carried out by the terrorists. The prosecution charged that a shootout broke out when the Delhi Police team arrived at Batla House. The cops had no alternative but to use fire as self-defence after ending up confined in the drawing room of the aforementioned house. Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and other officers were shot during the operation. The former lost his life and head constable Balwant was injured in the shooting. Two of the terrorists, including Ariz Khan were able to flee the apartment by the entrance while the other one who was present in the drawing room was wounded by bullets. Furthermore, the police did not open fire on Mohammed Saif who had locked himself inside the washroom and later surrendered before them.Atif Amin and Mohammad Sajid were killed in the face-off while Ariz Khan and three others managed to abscond. Ariz Khan was eventually apprehended in 2018 near the Nepal border after being labelled a proclaimed offender in 2009. He had a reward of 10 lakh rupees from the NIA and 5 lakh from the Delhi Police on any information leading to his arrest. Two other terrorists, Shahzad is serving life imprisonment whereas Junaid who had escaped is still at large.The trial court determined in its ruling that he was not only a menace to society but also an enemy of the state because of the heinous and savage act of firing on the police party without any provocation. He displayed no indications of change or penitence throughout the inquiry and trial. He was involved in various blast cases including Delhi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh which claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent people and injured many others. The court pronounced, “Convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live. After balancing mitigating circumstances against aggravating circumstances, it is concluded that it is a rarest of the rare case where convict deserves maximum sentence provided under law. It is the level of magnitude, decree of brutality, attitude and mindset of the wrongdoer behind the crime alongwith other factors which make it a rarest of the rare case. Interest of justice will be met if convict is awarded death penalty.”Ariz Khan was also given a fine of Rs. 11 lakh of which Rs. 10 lakh was to be paid as compensation to the wife of the deceased police officer. The Delhi High Court was then asked to confirm the death penalty in the case. He had submitted an appeal in opposition to the ruling. He was convicted of killing Mohan Chand Sharma at the encounter at South East Delhi’s Batla House by Delhi’s Saket Court in May 2021. He was deemed culpable by Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav of violating sections 186, 333, 353, 302 and 397 of the Indian Penal Code as well as section 27 of the Arms Act.Ariz Khan was represented by lawyers MS Khan, Prashant Prakash, Quasar Khan, and Rahul Sahan. Special Counsel Rajesh Mahajan together with advocates Asha Tiwari, Jyoti Babbar, Ranjeeb Kamal Bora, and Kuldeep Chauhan represented the Delhi Police.Sonia Gandhi shed tears for terrorists and opposition leaders cast aspersionsSalman Khurshid, a veteran Congress leader and former external affairs minister conveyed that Sonia Gandhi, the then-Congress President sobbed uncontrollably when she saw the photos of the terrorists who had been assassinated during one of his rallies during the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. He announced, “When we showed Sonia Gandhi the images of the ‘instance’ she started crying bitterly and with folded hands. She requested us not to show her these pictures and immediately go and speak with Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh to discuss the matter. I talked to the PM and it was decided that the matter would be further investigated.”Salman Khurshid, however, recanted his statement in 2019 and argued that it was taken out of context. “I never said that. In fact, I was misquoted. There was a difference between what I had said and what the media projected. I had said that the then Congress President didn’t wish to see visuals of an encounter (as the images are painful in nature).”An independent probe of the Batla House encounter was called for Aam Aadmi Party supremo and Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal who put into question the veracity of the matter. “The court has ruled that the youth (killed in the Batla House incident) were terrorists. I had said that even if they were terrorists, it was extremely important to catch them alive to know who their real handlers were. There needs to be an independent investigation to know if it was necessary to kill them. It must also be probed under what circumstances the police officer (Mohan Chand) was killed.” He called the encounter fake and alleged that his party members like Prashant Bhushan have been fighting battles for Muslims trapped in false cases such as Batla House.Mamata Banerjee, the head of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and West Bengal Chief Minister even threatened to end her political career if her claim that the Batla House encounter was fake turned out to be untrue back in 2008. “The encounter was fake. If it turns out to be false, then I will leave politics.”Digvijaya Singh, another stalwart leader of the Congress refused to apologise to the Bharatiya Janta Party for his accusation that the Batla House encounter was staged. “I will never apologise. I still maintain that encounter was fake,” he boasted while addressing the media in July 2013 during his visit to Indore. He emphasised once more that anyone dissatisfied with the outcome of the Batla House case can appeal to the Court.He had been calling for a judicial inquiry into the matter and claimed, “I have not seen the court order, nor am I one of the parties in the case. The parties in the case can accept it or appeal against it. It will be their decision.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

67,"12 October, 2023 ","Mutilated body, eyes gouged out: 13-year-old girl who had gone to madarsa for studies found dead in a field in UP’s Lakhimpur Kheri","The postmortem was performed on 10 October by three doctors and the report disclosed that she was strangled to death, but did not provide evidence of rapeOn 9 October, the mutilated body of a 13-year-old girl with her eyes gouged out was found in a sugarcane field in the Tikunia area of Lakhimpur Kheri district in Uttar Pradesh. Multiple wounds were inflicted on the dead body. The Muslim girl had left for a nearby madarsa on the morning of the previous day, however, failed to come back. लखीमपुर खीरी के 13 साल की नाबालिग के साथ हैवानियत गन्ने के खेत में मिला छत विछत शव दरिंदो ने बच्ची की दोनों आँख भी फोड़ी मदरसे से घर आते समय गायब हुई थी छात्रा तिकुनिया थाना क्षेत्र का है मामला @Uppolice @lakhimpurpolice @dgpup @myogiadityanath pic.twitter.com/v8AsGbgFEQThe incident pertained to the Singahi police station area where the infuriated people gathered around the vehicle of the Superintendent of Police Ganesh Prasad Saha and created a ruckus. There is a significant police presence in the village and experts in forensics also rushed to the area. The family members of the minor are charging that their daughter was raped. According to the report, she went to study at a local madarsa and the family grew concerned when she did not return till evening. They searched for her extensively but were unable to find her and lodged a missing complaint at Tikunia police station at around 12 a.m. Her corpse was recovered from a sugarcane field at around 1 p.m. near the hamlet. Her clothes were torn and in disarray, her mouth was stuffed with mud, horrifying injury marks covered her face and head, as well as both eyeballs were cut out. Her bag was also spotted near the body. Police reached the spot after receiving information and identified the body. The family members arrived there and recognised their daughter. They also engaged in an altercation with the police. A large group of locals assembled as soon as they learned about the occurrence. Her mother raised suspicion of sexual assault followed by murder after observing the condition of the deceased. She expressed, “My daughter had gone to study, but she didn’t return. We kept searching for her the whole night and complained to the police.” She claimed that cops did not take the complaint with seriousness. “She would still be alive today if they had looked for the girl at night. Her head had visible wounds. Her eyes were removed. Her mouth was full of mud. Someone had pressed her face into the ground for a long period of time.”On the night of 9 October when Ganesh Prasad Saha arrived at the crime scene multiple irate villagers encircled his car including the family member of the girl and demanded appropriate action from the authorities. The senior officer assured them of proper inquiry and took the body into their custody following much effort after which it was sent for postmortem. Regional leaders also came to the place of postmortem late in the evening.The top cop mentioned, “Injury marks were found on the girl’s head and body. Further action would be taken only after the autopsy analysis is conducted. We have formed teams to search for the accused. Squads from nearby police stations have also been dispatched. The perpetrators are going to be caught soon.”Meanwhile, the postmortem was performed on 10 October by three doctors and the report disclosed that she was strangled to death, but did not provide evidence of rape. The body was handed over to the family who refused to bury it until the culprits were behind bars and asked for compensation. Ganesh Prasad Saha has formed teams of three police stations under the leadership of Circle Officer Nighasan Rajesh Kumar along with the crime branch and surveillance to probe the gut-wrenching instance. He stressed that the entire episode would be exposed soon.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

68,"12 October, 2023 ","As Rahul Gandhi promotes caste politics in the country, Chinese commentator expresses confidence that India won’t be able to beat China due to caste conflicts","Xijin, who was earlier editor in chief of Chinese mouthpiece Global Times, was quoting a report related to the arrest of Chinese company Vivo executives in a money laundering caseOn 11th October, Chinese commentator Hu Xijin expressed confidence that India would be unable to beat China in the long run due to caste conflicts. Xijin, who was earlier editor in chief of Chinese mouthpiece Global Times, was quoting a report related to the arrest of Chinese company Vivo executives in a money laundering case.India’s attitude toward foreign companies is like a rogue state. I assert that India’s rise will not go far if it goes on like this. Extreme nationalism, arrogance, racial & caste conflicts will hinder or even destroy India’s modernization construction. pic.twitter.com/7450WP6OCgHu Xijin said, “India’s attitude toward foreign companies is like a rogue state. I assert that India’s rise will not go far if it goes on like this. Extreme nationalism, arrogance, racial & caste conflicts will hinder or even destroy India’s modernisation construction.”Interestingly, his statement came when Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has been pushing caste politics in every public meeting in poll-bound states. Notably, India will have Lok Sabha elections next year, and it seems caste politics will remain a hot topic for Congress during the campaign for the Lok Sabha elections.Rahul Gandhi started pushing caste politics on the day when the Woman Reservation Bill was being discussed in the Lok Sabha during the special session. He insinuated that the Indian government is not doing enough for the ‘marginalised’ communities, especially the SC/ST and OBCs, as their representation is minimal in civil services. However, he forgot that reservations in civil services were introduced in 1996, and most of the secretaries in ministries are from earlier batches. Gandhi’s push for caste politics became intense after Bihar released the caste census, pointing out that SC/ST and OBC make up a large portion of the population in the state. Interestingly, the Congress leader started pushing the idea of “Jitni Aabadi, Utna Haq”, which means the right to the country’s resources should be decided according to the community’s population.बिहार की जातिगत जनगणना से पता चला है कि वहां OBC + SC + ST 84% हैं। केंद्र सरकार के 90 सचिवों में सिर्फ़ 3 OBC हैं, जो भारत का मात्र 5% बजट संभालते हैं!इसलिए, भारत के जातिगत आंकड़े जानना ज़रूरी है। जितनी आबादी, उतना हक़ – ये हमारा प्रण है।In counter, PM Modi emphasised that for him, the poor are the largest community in the country irrespective of caste, religion or any other factor.""The poor have the first right to the country's resources. They can be from any community, whether it be SC, ST, OBC, or general category.""""Congress is yet to reveal details of MoU signed with 'another' country.""PM @narendramodi hits out at #Congress. #Chhattisgarh pic.twitter.com/4wmAgbvGWKCongress’ idea of distributing resources based on population will only create problems as there is no fixed population of any community in the states. While the SC/ST and OBCs comprise a large section of the population in Bihar, it will be completely different in the case of Punjab, where Sikhs are in the majority. Similarly, in Meghalaya, Christians are in the majority and in Jammu and Kashmir, Muslims are in the majority.The distribution of the resources must be based on the requirements of the country’s people irrespective of caste, religion, gender or other factors. If someone belongs to the general category and lives below the poverty line, that person or his family must have the right to get support from the government, in the same way a BPL family belonging to an SC/ST or OBC community gets.Earlier, when in 2006, Dr Manmohan Singh was Prime Minister, he famously said that the minority communities have the first right to the resources of the country, and among those, Muslims have the first claim. Though the left-liberals and Congress often try to whitewash his comments, saying then-PM Singh never said so, there is video proof of the same. His exact words were, “We will have to devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share the fruits of development equitably. These must have the first claim on resources.”After almost 17 years, Congress’s stand on who should get the first claim on the resources has shifted to the population of the communities. The poor, however, find no mention in the thought process of the Congress party.Furthermore, it is notable that dividing the country over caste and religion lines only creates hurdles in development. India’s most fierce competition, China, will prefer to see India facing trouble in reaching its goal of becoming the third largest economy. The statement by the Chinese commentator fits perfectly with the propaganda to divide India on the lines of caste-based population being pushed by Congress. Not to forget, Congress has a memorandum in place with the Chinese government signed in 2009, whose details are still opaque.It will be interesting to see how well Congress pushes caste-based politics as the Lok Sabha elections approach closer. Furthermore, Chinese mouthpieces and commentators are expected to have their own share to push the propaganda further.In 2008, during UPA1, the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Congress party signed an agreement for the sharing of high-level information and collaboration. The memorandum of understanding (MoU) also gave the two parties the “opportunity to consult each other on important bilateral, regional and international developments”. Notably, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra have been trustees of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation since 2005, while Sonia Gandhi is the foundation’s chairperson.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In a post on X, she dog whistled the Arab countries against the Modi government amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. She insinuated that if the Modi government did not show any solidarity with the Palestinian cause, it would damage the relationships between India and Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran and Egypt.What Hamas did in Israel is highly condemnable.

That being said, Arab countries have noticed the silence of the Modi govt on showing any solidarity with the Palestinian cause. At least 3 diplomats from the Arab countries, including an ambassador, said they were expecting a more balanced and nuanced statement from India. India has deep ties with Saudi, UAE, Qatar, Iran and Egypt, built over decades. The BJP govt now risks damaging them irreparably. Congress leader tries instigating Muslim countries against India for its stand against terrorist attack on Israel.”Notably, Shama’s statement came at a time when Hamas’ leader called for “global Jihad” on 13th October. Khalid Mashal, leader and founding member of Hamas, urged Muslims worldwide to initiate “Global Jihad”. He also asked for donations donning them as “Financial Jihad” so that Hamas could continue the war against Israel. He urged them to express anger and protest on “the Friday of Al-Aqsa flood” to send a message to Israel and its allies. Mashal called for political pressure from Muslim leaders and nations to stop Israel’s military attack on Gaza. Most significantly, he called for Muslims to engage in physical Jihad, asking them to be willing to fight and potentially give their lives for Al-Aqsa.Khalid Mashal the leader and founding member of Hamas gave a speech today asking Muslims all around the world to do the following:⁰⁰1. To show anger, especially next Friday, in Muslim countries and Also among Muslim diaspora around the world; he called it “the Friday of Al-Aqsa… pic.twitter.com/koJ42DRFMyIt is interesting to note that Shama mentioned Qatar, a country on the net, for potentially funding and/or aiding Hamas from time to time. Qatar, a U.S. ally, has been accused of supporting Hamas, a designated Palestinian terror organisation, in an attempt to help establish peace between Israel and Palestine. This support has raised concerns due to Qatar’s past of providing financial assistance to different extremist groups.Khaled Meeshal, the former leader of Hamas, resided in Qatar for a long time and held press conferences on behalf of terror organisations there. In May 2021, Qatar pledged $500 million to rebuild the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip during heightened tensions between Palestine and Israel, once again drawing attention to Qatar’s financial support for Hamas and other international terrorist organisations. Qatar’s involvement in the Israel-Palestine conflict is part of its broader geopolitical strategy in the Middle East.While Shama mentioned Egypt, she conveniently missed that Egypt has normalised relationships with Israel since 1980 under a peace treaty. The country has been a mediator between Israel and Hamas several times to ensure peace in the region. Reacting to the terror attack by Hamas and counter-attack by Israel, Egypt called for exercising maximum restraint and avoiding exposing civilians to further danger”. Egypt currently fears an influx of refugees from Palestine, which would be bad for its economy and has closed the Rafah crossing to avoid exodus.Among the list of countries, Shama mentioned UAE, a country that has called for peace and revival of a normalised relationship between Arab countries and Israel. The United Arab Emirates expressed a deep concern about the recent escalation of violence between Israel and Palestine and called for an immediate end to the conflict to safeguard civilians. The UAE has extended condolences to all the victims of the conflict and urged the international Quartet to work towards promoting peace between Arab and Israeli communities. They have also urged the global community to achieve a comprehensive and fair peace agreement and prevent further violence and instability in the region.In addition, the UAE condemned Hamas’ attack, considering it a serious escalation, and expressed dismay towards the reports of Israeli civilians being taken as hostages. They emphasised protecting Israeli and Palestinian civilians under international humanitarian law. The UAE maintained a balanced approach by expressing its concerns while avoiding direct criticism towards Israel’s actions in Gaza.Though Saudi Arabia and Iran have sided more with Palestine in the matter, it is important to note that in most of the cases where countries go head-on with each other, India prefers to form a neutral stand. However, in the case of the Israel-Hamas war, the matter is complicated. While India has supported the Palestinian cause in the past and vouched for the two-nation theory to ensure peace in the region, this time, no word has been spoken on the Palestinian cause. India has unequivocally condemned the terrorist attack in Israel while not naming Palestine.Hamas, the Palestinian terrorist organisation, killed over 1,200 Israelis, including 150+ soldiers, women, elderly and children on a Jewish holiday. Several foreign nationals were killed or abducted by Hamas terrorists. Israeli forces are still discovering bodies, some of them were charred to death. Burnt houses, dead families and ruined villages show how horrendous the attack was. Expecting India to side with Palestine at such a time for some brownie points from the Arab countries is not what India stands for. In fact, India’s reaction has been similar to what most of the powerful world leaders were for the attack on Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

70,"12 October, 2023 ","Canada: New anti-India hoarding comes up at Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s Gurdwara in Surrey saying ‘Wanted Modi, Jaishankar, Ambassador Sanjay Verma’","The new hoarding outside Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara temple in Surrey calls Narendra Modi, Minister of External Affairs Dr S. Jaishankar and India's high commissioner to Ottawa Sanjay Kumar Verma 'enemy of India'There seems to be no end to pro-Khalistan activities in Canada as a fresh hoarding labelling Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Minister of External Affairs Dr S. Jaishankar and India’s high commissioner to Ottawa Sanjay Kumar Verma as ‘Wanted’ has been installed outside Gurdwara Nanak Dev in Surrey where terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar was assassinated in June of this year, per a report by CNN-News18. This comes less than a month after similar hoardings were removed from the Gurudwara and then put up again just two days later, which had called for the assassination of three Indian diplomats in Canada, one high commissioner and two consul generals. The new hoarding features pictures of Narendra Modi, J Jaishankar and Sanjay Kumar Verma with ‘Enemies of Canada’ written on top and ‘wanted’ written on the bottom. it also has the image of Hardeep Singh Nijjar who is referred to as a ‘martyr’ with the words ‘Khalistan Referendum’. Extremist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun’s separatist organisation Sikhs For Justice is behind the incident and police are reportedly aware of the same, however, no action has been taken to apprehend the offenders. Before this new hoarding appeared, several hoardings and posters were put up at the gurdwara earlier calling for the assassination of Indian diplomats. The recent hoardings which were removed in the last week of September were installed after the killing of Nijjar, and it called for the assassination of heads of three Indian missions in Canada – Ottawa-based Indian High Commissioner Sanjay Kumar Verma, Consul General of India in Toronto Apoorva Srivastava, and Consul General of India Vancouver Manish. The poster had the words ‘Assassination wanted’ with the names and photos of the diplomats, and it glorified Hardeep Singh Nijjar and Talwinder Singh Parmar, Babbar Khalsa founder and the mastermind of the 1985 Air India Flight 182 bombing that killed 329 people. Apart from this, the Gurudwara regularly puts up hoardings and posters on the so-called ‘Khalistan referendum’.After the collapse of diplomatic relations between India and Canada after PM Justin Trudeau accused India of being involved in the murder of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, there were lots of outrage against the hoardings outside the Gurudwara. As a result, they were taken down, apparently on the orders of local administration. However, the hoardings had come back just two days later. Now new hoardings have appeared with new names of targets.Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau attributed the murder of the pro-Khalistan radical to the Indian government on the basis of “credible allegations” without providing any evidence. India responded firmly and refuted the unfounded accusations which heightened the existing acute tensions between the two countries.After Canada dismissed India’s diplomat the Canadian High Commissioner to India Cameron MacKay was summoned and a senior Canadian diplomat was informed to leave the country in addition to suspending visas to the country’s nationals in retaliation. New Delhi last month told Ottawa to withdraw 41 of its 62 diplomats in the country by 10 October and warned that diplomats who stayed beyond the deadline would lose diplomatic immunity. The Maple Country began the process to do so, however, negotiations about the same are presently underway between the two nations. Canada has gradually turned into a sanctuary for pro-separatist elements who frequently indulge in anti-India and Hinduphobic activities including vandalisation of Indian high commission, desecration of temples and threatening Hindus living in the western country.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Garba, Aarti n all, that too in Gujarat""? X user Mr Sinha asked. On 12th October, the Pakistan cricket team arrived in Ahmedabad ahead of their match with India in the ongoing ICC World Cup. A video of the Pakistani team being welcomed by dancing Gujarati girls, popular Bollywood songs and some ‘extra’ flourish of balloons and flowers all around went viral on social media. #Ahmedabad welcomes Team Pakistan🇵🇰Love Culture of India🇮🇳❤️#CWC23 #CWC2023 #INDvAFG #INDvsPAK #INDvPAK #ShubmanGill #RohitSharma𓃵 #RohithSharma #ViratKohli #AUSvsSA #AUSvSA #Israel #Gaza #TrainAccident #TRAIN #trainderailed #Hamas #FreeGaza #Palestine #Bihar #BiharNews pic.twitter.com/7wsU5gs2BaThe visuals of a rousing, extravagant welcome to the Pakistani team did not go down well with most social media users. “This is disgusting!

This kind of ‘special event’ has not been there for any other match. And the BCCI did not even have an opening ceremony ahead of the ICC World Cup.

When there's no opening ceremony, it is disgusting that there will be a ""special ceremony"" for the India-Pak game. It is insulting to every other team.

The India-Pakistan match is scheduled on Saturday, 14th October in Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi stadium.

72,"12 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: Pregnant woman from UP with her IITian husband and daughter stuck in the Negev Desert in Southern Israel,"While the Times of India said that the family is stuck in Tel Aviv, actually Sde Boker is over 170 km away from the Israeli capital, located in the heart of the Negev Desert in Southern Israel, and there is no report of any Hamas rocket attack on the small locality Amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war following the horrific terror attack by Hamas on 7 October, a large number of foreigners are stranded in Israel. Among them is a family from Amroha, Uttar Pradesh, including a couple and their child, who are presently stuck in Israel amidst ongoing conflict, according to a report in The Times of India. The family includes thirty-year-old Jaideep Kaur, who is six months pregnant, her thirty-year-old spouse Mohit Randhawa who is an IITian (Indian Institutes of Technology) from Roorkee, and their three-year-old daughter.The couple said that had never heard such an incessant clamour of sirens since arriving in the country after their wedding in 2020. Jaideep Kaur had a FaceTime interview from Tel Aviv in which she stated, “On October 7, around 6:30 am, the shrieking sound jolted us out of slumber. Within no time we were made to vacate our accommodations and move to a nearby shelter on the university campus (of Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research.”She explained that when the pair evacuated they could only bring a few snacks and the essential necessities. “Later, we got to know the heavy concrete dwelling was impenetrable for the bombs and rockets raining on us. It kept us safe. In all, we were 50 in that bunker.” The family is stranded in Sde Boker which is 74 kilometres from Gaza. She was expected to fly to India on 12 October to give birth at her parents’ house in Uttar Pradesh. “But the attack jeopardised all our plans. Let’s see what happens.” She conveyed, “Thankfully, we had Wi-Fi inside the shelter and could see videos and news of the horrific attack. My husband took away the phone and later allowed me to watch only web series but no news in order to prevent me from anxiety considering my pregnancy. We pray everything becomes normal and we get to meet our family in India soon. We cannot talk to them on the phone or WhatsApp, FaceTime is the only option available as of now.”Her family was worried because they were unable to reach her for three days. Her 55-year-old father Surendra Singh Dhillon informed, “On Tuesday morning, around 11 am, I managed to connect with her after numerous failed attempts and was relieved to hear that my daughter, son-in-law and their kid are safe for now. I request the Indian government to safely evacuate those stuck in the war zone.”Mohit Randhawa has ties with The Zuckerberg Institute for Water Research at the Jacob Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research in Midreshet Ben-Gurion, near Sder Boker.It is notable that while the Times of India said that the family is stuck in Tel Aviv, actually Sde Boker is over 170 km away from the Israeli capital. It is located in the heart of the Negev Desert in Southern Israel. Moreover, there is no report of any Hamas bombing in the town. Hamas attacked Israeli areas close to the border, and most of its rockets are short-range.While Hamas does have long-range rockets that can strike at a distance of up to 250 km, they are not guided, and they are used to strike heavily populated areas and cities in central and northern Israel. It is unlikely the terror organisation will fire a long-range rocket towards Sde Boker, a small town of around 1 square kilometre area with less than 500 population in the middle of a massive desert, as the probability of an unguided rocket hitting the kibbutz is extremely low. However, sirens did go off in Sde Boker and other areas far from the Gaza border on 7 October as a precautionary measure. Israelis heard sirens just before dawn on 7 October as they were winding up the seven-day Jewish festival of Sukkot and they soon realised it wasn’t a false alarm. A massive surprise attack was being carried out by hordes of Hamas terrorists from the air, the sea and the ground which resulted in the gruesome murder of at least 1200 people including women children and the elderly as well as wounded thousands of others. Hundreds of them were abducted and taken hostage by the assailants who also raped women. Many victims were left in the streets of cities and buildings were completely destroyed as thousands of missiles fired from Gaza flew through the sky and started raining down on random targets in the Jewish country. Simultaneously, hundreds of armed terrorists, many of whom were riding motorbikes stormed into communities as bulldozers breached the border between Israel and Gaza, catching Israeli soldiers off guard and opening fire on civilians.Responding to the horrifying assault the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on 7 October launched Operation ‘Iron Swords’ and began targeting Hamas targets in Gaza. All of the terrorists who sneaked into the country and targeted both civilians and Israeli security troops were taken into account in the operation.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

73,"12 October, 2023 ","At least 22 Americans killed in terrorist attack on Israel by Hamas, US looking for details about hostages","The US has increased military assistance to Israel including ammunition and interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome.At least 22 Americans have been killed in the 7th October terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. The information was released by National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby at a news conference on 11th October.Kirby couldn’t confirm details like where and how the Americans were killed as the “individual circumstances are not exactly clear”. More than 1,200 people have died in the Hamas attacks on Israel.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to reach Israel on Thursday and will meet senior officials.“The Secretary will reiterate his condolences for the victims of the terrorist attacks against Israel and condemn those attacks in the strongest terms,” the US Embassy in Israel said in a statement.Blinken, during his visit to Israel, will be discussing “measures to bolster Israel’s security” and underscore the United States’ “unwavering support” for Israel.The Biden administration is reportedly searching for details about the condition of the US citizens believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. CNN quoted a US official as saying that US is working to determine how many are being held captive in Gaza or if they are currently being held in one place.On Wednesday (11th October), US President Joe Biden said he had seen pictures of “terrorists beheading children” confirming reports that Hamas had beheaded babies in the course of its onslaught on Israel. “I never really thought that I would see…have confirmed pictures of terrorists beheading children,” Biden said.However, the Biden administration later clarified that neither the President nor the administration had seen such pictures or confirmed such reports. The White House clarified that Biden had seen reports claiming that children were beheaded.The US has increased military assistance to Israel including ammunition and interceptors to replenish the Iron Dome. “We are going to make sure that Israel does not run out of these critical assets to defend its cities and its citizens,” the US President said.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

74,"12 October, 2023 ",Harvard University: Truck displaying names of signatories of pro-Hamas statement circles the campus,"The electronic billboard displayed the names and pictures of the signatories of the controversial statement under the banner ""Harvard's Leading Anti-semites.""Even as the Harvard students who signed a student union coalition statement blaming Israel for Hamas terrorist attack have backtracked from supporting the Palestinian terrorist group, a ‘doxxing truck’ was seen on Wednesday (11th October) moving around the streets of Harvard University campus. The electronic billboard displayed the names and pictures of the signatories of the controversial statement under the banner “Harvard’s Leading Anti-semites.”The display also featured a website named “Harvard Hates Jews” that revealed the identities of students affiliated with groups that have signed on to the Palestine Solidarity Committee’s statement placing the sole blame for the ongoing violence on Israel. The website asserted that the Hamas terrorists killed hundreds of men, women, and children in Israel. Among the dead were Jews, Christians, Israelis, Europeans, and Americans. It added that the Hamas strike was “not just against Israel but against the Western civilisation.” It further stated that it was shocking that the radical ‘scholars’ at Harvard issued a statement supporting the terrorists and blaming the victim.Moreover, the website offered the visitors to send a message to Harvard’s board of trustees “to take action against the despicable, hateful students.”Prior to this, at least four websites had published the personal information of students associated with groups that had signed onto the statement, including complete names, class years, previous employment, social media profiles, photographs, and hometowns. However, it is reported that two of those sites had been taken down for violating the terms of service laid down by Google.Notably, the doxxing truck was deployed by Accuracy In Media(AIM), a US-based conservative media watchdog. Taking to X, Adam Guillette, the AIM’s President took responsibility for the doxxing billboard. He also stated that the AIM team is removing names of the students who withdrew support to the pro-Palestine statement but also adding new names every hour.“Want to know who the leading antisemites at @Harvard are? Click on the link below. @AccuracyInMedia is removing the names of students from groups that withdrew but is also adding new names every hour. And yes, that’s our billboard on their campus,” Guillette posted.Want to know who the leading antisemites at @Harvard are?

These student groups are Harvard College Act on a Dream, Amnesty International at Harvard, the Harvard Islamic Society, Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo, and the Harvard Undergraduate Nepali Student Association.This comes after a student union coalition at Harvard University issued a statement on 7th October blaming Israel for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The letter issued by the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups was co-signed by 33 student groups.“The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years. From systematized land seizures to routine airstrikes, arbitrary detentions to military checkpoints, and enforced family separations to targeted killings, Palestinians have been forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden,” the letter reads.The terrorist organisation Hamas launched a devastating terror strike on Israeli soil on 7th October. Over 900 people were killed in the attack. Paragliders and vehicle-borne Hamas terrorists brandishing automatic weapons stormed the border fences, attacking civilians, residential communities, and even a music festival in Southern Israel. In retaliation to the brutal terrorist attack,  Israel declared war on Hamas and has been bombarding the Gaza Strip with bombs for three days. Hundreds of Israelis and other nationals have been reported to have been kidnapped by Hamas. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

75,"12 October, 2023 ","IDF’s retaliatory bombing against Hamas: 11 UN staffers, 30 students in UN-run schools killed in Gaza","The Israel Air Force's chief of staff, Brigadier General Omer Tishler said that the Israeli Air Force was not targeting civilians in the Gaza Strip, but that the strikes were no longer ""surgical"". At least 11 United Nations staff and personnel, as well as 30 students at UN schools, have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the October 7 attack by Hamas terrorists on Isreal, reported The Times of Israel.UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said, “11 United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) staff and personnel have been killed since Saturday”, referring to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees which also runs schools in Gaza.“30 UNRWA students have also been killed and another eight have been injured,” she said. The victims include five teachers, a gynaecologist, an engineer, a counsellor, and three support staff, UNRWA’s deputy director Jennifer Austin said in a statement.She further said, “UNRWA mourns this loss and is grieving with our colleagues and the families. UN staff and civilians must be protected at all times during conflict. We call for the fighting to come to an end to spare more civilian lives lost.”Reportedly, over 250,000 people in Gaza have fled from their homes, the UN said.However, most of these people have crowded into schools run by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, The Times of Israel reported.Marking the sixth day of the fatal rocket fire attack by Hamas, over 1,200 people have been killed, more than 3000 injured and an estimated 100-150 were abducted and taken to the Gaza Strip.The Israel Air Force’s chief of staff, Brigadier General Omer Tishler said that the Israeli Air Force was not targeting civilians in the Gaza Strip, but that the strikes were no longer “surgical”.“We do not act like the other side, we do not attack the civilian population. Behind every attack there is a target,” he said. “We act precisely and professionally but not surgically. I’m not talking about single, tens, or hundreds [of strikes]. We are talking about thousands of munitions,” Tishler said.Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant on Monday said that he has ordered a “complete siege” of the Gaza Strip.“I have ordered a complete siege on the Gaza Strip. There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed,” Gallant said. “We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly,” he added.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday called on to protect civilians, and for international humanitarian law to be upheld.“About 220,000 Palestinians are now sheltering in 92 UNRWA facilities across Gaza,” he said, adding that UN premises, hospitals, clinics and schools must “never be targeted.”The Palestinian envoy also mentioned Israel’s Defence Minister’s statement in the letter, which said, “We are fighting human animals… We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. There will be no electricity, no water, no fuel. Everything will be closed”.He claimed that “Israeli occupying forces (IOF)” continue attacking civilian areas across the Gaza Strip, firing missiles, bombs and artillery by air, land and sea. Violating all rules of international humanitarian law, Israel is deliberately targeting homes, including apartment buildings, refugee camps, hospitals and other medical facilities, UNRWA schools, mosques, and other civilian properties and infrastructure, including roads, hampering the passage of emergency vehicles and access of humanitarian personnel to aid the wounded.The letter mentioned that the casualties are estimated at 849 Palestinians killed, including families in their entirety throughout Gaza, and over 5,350 wounded by lethal IOF attacks in the days since Israel began its onslaught on 7 October. The toll is rising by the minute.He emphasised that the harm being done to children and women is unspeakable. Children are being traumatized and terrorized, orphaned by the hundreds as their parents are murdered before their eyes, displaced as their homes are blown up and reduced to rubble, and are among the dead and wounded, with reports of over 140 children killed. As of this writing, it is estimated that more than 80 women are also among the dead, with casualty figures still rising.Giving details about the destruction, the Palestinian envoy sought the stop the bloodshed and save civilian lives and reiterated that the targeting of civilians must be halted immediately.Meanwhile, earlier, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said that the US was “actively discussing” with Israel and Egypt to ensure safe passage for civilians from Gaza, according to The Times of Israel.“We support safe passage for civilians. Civilians are not to blame for what Hamas has done. They didn’t do anything wrong, and we continue to support safe passage,” Kirby said during a press briefing.As of Wednesday, the coastal enclave, home to 2.3 million people have been dealing with deteriorating condition as entire city blocks were reduced to rubble and residents searched for places to go.Moreover, the power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased operations on Wednesday afternoon after running out of fuel, the Gaza Energy Authority announced, The Jerusalem Post reported.In an update posted on X, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said that dozens of warplanes attacked more than 80 targets throughout Beit Hanon during the night.“Dozens of warplanes attacked over 80 targets throughout Beit Hanon during the night. Among other things, the planes attacked two bank branches used by the terrorist organization Hamas to finance terrorism in the Gaza Strip, an underground terrorist tunnel in the territory of the Gaza Strip and two operational headquarters used by the terrorist organization Hamas to direct terrorism to the State of Israel,” IDF posted on X.Gaza’s Civil Defense Department has warned that there were only a few rescue teams to search for survivors buried under rubble and that teams were unable to reach many places owing to the damaged roads and constant bombardments.“There is no safe place in Gaza right now,” said journalist Hasan Jabar after three Palestinian journalists were killed in the bombardment of a downtown neighbourhood home to government ministries, media offices and hotels. “I am genuinely afraid for my life.” (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

76,"12 October, 2023 ",Sikh man who housed Khalistani terrorists allowed asylum in Canada despite objections by border service authorities,"The original decision to deny entry to Indian citizen Kamaljit Ram came up after he told the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) that he ""housed and fed armed Sikh militants on and off between 1982 and 1992 at his farm in India.""A Canadian immigration panel ruled that a Sikh man who provided shelter to Khalistani terrorists in India for almost a decade should be permitted to stay in Canada, adding that he did so “mostly out of necessity” and fear of reprisal. The decision in this regard came on 29th August this year.The original decision to deny entry to Indian citizen Kamaljit Ram came up after he told the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) that he “housed and fed armed Sikh militants on and off between 1982 and 1992 at his farm in India.” He also told them that he supported the separatist ideas propagated by the adherents of slain Khalistani terrorist Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale.Moreover, Kamaljit Ram claimed in his interviews with CBSA that he did not voluntarily house the armed Khalistani terrorists saying that although he was not supportive of the Khalistani ideology, the terrorists would arrive at his farm located outside the village considering it a safe place and demand food and shelter.“Mr Ram stated at various times that he did not voluntarily house and feed armed activists and that he was not a supportive member of this group. However, as the activists knew that his farm was outside the village and that it was a safe place to take refuge, they showed up at his house and demanded shelter and food, whether Mr. Ram actively supports them or not,” the Reasons and Decisions document stated.Notably, it was alleged that there were numerous inconsistencies in the statements made by Kamaljit Ram in CBSA interviews and his testimony at the inquiry. Moreover, Kamaljit gave inconsistent responses regarding the number of times Khalistani terrorists arrived at his farm seeking food and shelter, and the duration and dates of their visits. “However, he always maintained that he did not actively seek to help the activist groups, but that he acceded to their requests or their needs for food and shelter when theycame to his house.”However, the tribunal of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) observed that the federal government did not have “reasonable grounds” to stop Ram from entering Canada. Heidi Worsfold, an IRB tribunal member, stated that the government failed to include in its assessment that Ram repeatedly stated that he agreed to host the armed individuals because he “feared the consequences” of ending up on the wrong end of the Khalistani group.“The atmosphere in the Sikh community of the 1980s was rife with militancy where groups of militants, including the Bhindranwale followers, as well as the police created an atmosphere of fear and distrust among many of the local residents,” the court’s verdict said.The decision comes in the midst of a diplomatic conflict between India and Canada in the aftermath of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations of the “potential” involvement of Indian agents in the June 18 killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia, a claim India dismissed as “absurd” and “motivated.” It was worth recalling that two masked attackers had shot Nijjar dead. Nijjar was designated a terrorist by India in 2020.Canada providing a safe haven to wanted criminals and terrorists from India has been a constant issue haunting the bilateral relations of the two nations.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Ezzo was grounded earlier after screenshots of his objectionable social media posts went viral.In a post on X, Air Canada said, “We can confirm the pilot in question no longer works for Air Canada, following the process initiated on Monday.”We can confirm the pilot in question no longer works for Air Canada, following the process initiated on Monday. https://t.co/U9rTkBM7Z2Mostafa was grounded on 10th October by Air Canada pending investigation into his controversial social media posts calling for genocide of Jews. In one of his stories, Mostafa was wearing the Palestinian flag on his uniform. In another photograph, he was seen holding a placard that read, “Israel, Hitler is proud of you”. In another photograph, he was seen holding a placard with a figure throwing the Israeli flag in the dustbin with the caption “Keep the world clean”. In another story, he wrote, “f*ck you, Israel. Burn in Hell.”According to a report in the Toronto Sun, the action was taken after concerns about the social media posts allegedly containing profane commentary about Israel from the pilot. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick told the Toronto Star, “We did this because this individual’s opinions and publications on social media do not represent Air Canada’s views in any way.” He added, “This person has never been authorised to speak publicly while identifying themselves as an Air Canada employee.” Mostafa’s Instagram page has been deactivated. It is unclear if he did it himself or if he was deplatformed by Instagram.On 7th October (local time), the terrorist organisation Hamas launched a brutal terror attack on Israeli soil. Over 1,200 people were killed in the attack. Paragliders and vehicle-borne Hamas terrorists wielding automatic weapons barged inside the border walls and attacked civilians, residential communities, and even a music festival in Southern Israel. In response to the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that killed over 900 civilians and wounded over 2,500 others, Israel has declared war on Hamas and has been pounding the Gaza Strip with bombs for 3 days now.The US and other NATO nations have declared support for Israel. Hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Hamas has massacred civilians brutally after attacking a music festival, and family homes in Southern Israel.

79,"12 October, 2023 ","Israel-Hamas War: Death toll crosses 2,400 as Netanyahu vows to finish Hamas, and IDF bombs Gaza in retaliation for terrorist attacks on civilians","Israel is also planning to start ground operations soon to clear out the Gaza Strip of Hamas terrorists. Meanwhile, Hamas's top leaders called for ""global Jihad"" in Arab and Islamic countries on 13th October (Friday) and urged Muslims around the world for donations (Financial Jihad) to continue the war against Israel.On 11th October, the total death toll in the Israel-Hamas conflict, including Hamas Terrorist Attack on Israel and Israel’s counterattack on Gaza, crossed 2,400. Both sides have claimed almost equal numbers of dead, including children, elderly and women.As per reports, the Israel Defence Force (IDF) said over 1,200 people have died since the 7th October attack, including 155 soldiers. Around 150 civilians and soldiers were taken hostage by the Hamas terrorists. On the other hand, Gaza authorities have claimed that around 1,200 people have died, including nine medics of the Red Crescent in the Israeli counterattack.The death toll on the Gaza side is expected to increase once the rubble of the buildings demolished by Israeli air strikes gets cleared. Despite facing the largest counter-strike by Israel, Hamas is not backing down and continuously firing rockets at Israel. The rockets coming from Gaza led to the temporary closure of Ben Gurion Airport. It also affected the civilian life in Ashkelon.Israel has closed all the entry points to Gaza, leading to food, fuel and medicine shortages. The humanitarian groups working in Gaza claimed that due to the blockade, they faced difficulty getting their hands on medicine and food. The sole power plant of Gaza is also shut down due to fuel shortage.While Gaza authorities claimed they were facing humanitarian disaster, the Israeli government has no plan to back out of its decision to completely degrade Hamas’ military potential.Amid the ongoing war, the students in Israel have been unable to attend school since last week. However, the education ministry has announced they would soon shift to remote learning, possibly from 15th October. As the ministry is planning to shift to remote learning, there is a possibility that Israel expects the war to continue for some time. In a post on X, the ministry said, “Starting next Sunday, all students will return to distance learning, including the kindergartens. The schools will move to a format of regular and continuous learning, through lesson plans adapted to both the possibility of distance learning and the possibility of physical learning in the schools. Learning will focus on emotional and social aspects to strengthen the students’ personal resilience.” (translated using Google Translate)החל מיום ראשון הקרוב כלל התלמידים ישובו ללמידה מרחוק, כולל גני הילדיםבתי הספר יעברו למתכונת של למידה סדירה ורציפה, באמצעות מערכי שיעור המותאמים הן לאפשרות של למידה מרחוק והן לאפשרות של למידה פיזית בבתי הספר. הלמידה תתמקד בהיבטים רגשיים וחברתיים לחיזוק החוסן האישי של התלמידיםIsrael is also planning to start ground operations soon to clear out the Gaza Strip of Hamas terrorists.

80,"12 October, 2023 ",“I am shocked”: Former Israeli envoy to India calls out Shashi Tharoor for not calling Hamas terrorists,"In response to Carmon, the Congress MP argued that India has not issued such a label to HamasCongress MP Shashi Tharoor has drawn flak from former Israeli ambassador to India Daniel Carmon for not calling Hamas a terrorist group. In a video that has gone viral on X, formerly Twitter, Shashi Tharoor, while talking to India Today anchor Rajdeep Sardesai, said, “The terrorist organisation label is one that we are very careful not to follow other country’s leads in these matters. The US considers Hamas a terrorist organisation so does Israel. India has not made any such classification and I am gonna stick to the Indian position.”Seriously, @ShashiTharoor,can you not?After decades of terror against my people,challenging the very Palestinian Authority,especially after this week’s savage slaughter of over a thousand peaceful human beings,can you not label Hamas as terrorists?Frankly,I am shocked.#HamasISIS https://t.co/G1crdOtRszThe interview was shared by many users on the internet including Daniel Carmon who did not mince his words in criticising Tharoor. He wrote, “Seriously, @ShashiTharoor, can you not? After decades of terror against my people, challenging the very Palestinian Authority, especially after this week’s savage slaughter of over a thousand peaceful human beings, can you not label Hamas as terrorists? Frankly, I am shocked.”In response to Carmon, the Congress MP argued that India has not issued such a label to Hamas. “All I said was that India has not issued such a designation, though others have. Undoubtedly Hamas conducted terrorist acts, which I roundly condemned. Don’t be misled by crude headlines seeking to distort my words, @danielocarmon. I feel for you and other friends in Israel at this difficult time, and hope & pray for your continued safety,” Tharoor wrote.Even as Tharoor used the Prime Minister’s statement to justify not calling Hamas terrorists, several users replied to the MP pointing out that PM Modi has categorically called the attacks on Israel as “terrorist attacks”.The Indian PM has clearly called it a terror attack. Which part of that message wasn't clear to you? Your Congress Party has a soft corner for Hamas, which is more than clear now.Moreover, in an exclusive conversation with NDTV, Tharoor lobbied for Palestine saying that “India should not forget the cause of Palestine”.“India has so far — judging by the Prime Minister’s Tweets — has taken a stand unambiguously on the side of Israelis who have been subjected to this unjust and inhumane attack by the Hamas. That’s fine as far as it goes. But it doesn’t go far enough because there is a broader picture that seems to be missing from the traditional Indian position,” he told NDTV.On 9th October, just two days after the terrorist attack by Hamas, the Congress Party expressed its sympathy for Palestinians. The Congress passed a resolution voicing concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire, however, backed Palestine.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

82,"11 October, 2023 ","Union Cabinet approves royalty rates for mining of 3 critical and strategic minerals including Lithium, enabling the govt to auction blocks for the first time","The union govt amended the mines and minerals act to specify the rate of royalty with respect to 3 critical and strategic minerals, namely, Lithium, Niobium, and Rare Earth ElementsOn 11th October (Wednesday), the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved the amendment of the Second Schedule of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (‘MMDR Act’). This would specify the rate of royalty with respect to 3 critical and strategic minerals, namely, Lithium, Niobium, and Rare Earth Elements (REEs), a PIB statement said.The rate of royalty fixed for these critical and strategic minerals is as follows – (i)  Lithium – 3% of London Metal Exchange (LME) price,(ii)  Niobium –3% of the Average Sale Price (both for primary and secondary sources),(iii) Rare Earth Elements – 1% of the Average Sale Price of Rare Earth OxideThe Cabinet’s decision to specify the rate of royalty for these minerals will enable the Central Government to auction blocks for Lithium, Niobium, and REEs for the first time in the country. Taking to X, Union Minister for Coals and Mines, Pralhad Joshi highlighted that this decision will allow the central government, for the first time, to auction these minerals. He also added that this decision will attract active participation from the bidders and boast the economic activities that are dependent on these minerals in the coming days.The cabinet headed by Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi Ji has approved royalty rates for 3 critical minerals, including Lithium and Niobium. This decision will allow the central government, for the first time, to auction these minerals. This will not only attract active… pic.twitter.com/ABvoB58izOHailing the decision, PM Modi stated, “Today’s Cabinet decision is great news for the sector and will also boost economic activities.” Today's Cabinet decision is great news for the sector and will also boost economic activities. https://t.co/jjOoe21VRc https://t.co/drWItXTUfWIt is important to note that the royalty rate on minerals is believed to be one of the important financial considerations for the bidders in the auction of blocks. Further, the Ministry of Mines has also prepared the manner for calculation of the Average Sale Price (ASP) of these minerals which will enable the determination of bid parameters.Recently, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2023 was passed by the Parliament. Subsequently, it came into force on 17th August 2023.The Amendment delisted six minerals which included Lithium and Niobium, from the list of atomic minerals. With this, it allowed the grant of concessions for these minerals to the private sector through auction.Further, the amendment allowed the Central Government to auction the mining lease and composite license of 24 critical and strategic minerals (which are listed in Part D of the First Schedule of the Act), including Lithium, Niobium, and REEs (not containing Uranium and Thorium).Notably, the royalty rates for various minerals are provided in the Second Schedule of the MMDR Act. Under the previous rule, if royalty rates for certain minerals weren’t mentioned specifically, they were set at 12% of the Average Sale Price (ASP) which would have pegged the royalty rate for Lithium, Niobium, and REE at 12% of the ASP, the default royalty rate. However, this royalty rate of 12% would not have been comparable with other mineral-producing countries and was considerably high compared to other critical and strategic minerals.Further, the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and other exploration agencies have been conducting explorations to find critical and strategic minerals in the country and hasrecently handed over the exploration report of REE and Lithium blocks.The government is planning to soon start auctioning critical and strategic minerals like Lithium, REE, Nickel, Platinum Group of Elements, Potash, Glauconite, Phosphorite, Graphite, Molybdenum, and others.Critical minerals have now become indispensable for the country’s economic growth and national security. Minerals like Lithium and REEs, in particular, have gained immense importance in line with India’s dedication to energy transition and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070. The strategic significance of minerals such as Lithium, Niobium, and REEs has grown due to their various applications and the geopolitical landscape. Promoting domestic mining would reduce the need for imports and pave the way for the development of associated industries and infrastructure projects. Moreover, this proposal is anticipated to boost employment opportunities in the mining sector.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

83,"12 October, 2023 ",Israel-Hamas war: Sirens go off across northern Israel after dozens of aircraft infiltrate Israeli airspace from Lebanon,"Residents in northern Israel were asked to lock their houses and enter shelters due to threats of bombings and terror attacks from LebanonAs Israel continues retaliatory military action against Hamas in Gaza following the horrific multi-front terror attack by Hamas in Southern Israel on Saturday (7 October), the attacks on Israel from Lebanon in the north has also intensified. After missiles and mortars were fired into Israel from Lebanon, the base of the armed group Hezbollah, today sirens went off in towns across northern Israel after several drones infiltrated from Lebanon.Reports suggest that dozens of drones were launched from Lebanon into Israel. As a result, alarms were sounded in several places including the Golan Heights, Tiberias, Safed, Beit Shean and other areas. Residents in those places were asked to lock their houses and enter shelters due to threats of bombings and terror attacks.As per a report by Channel 12, 15 to 20 drones and aircraft were spotted near Upper Galilee in northern Israel. The head of the Galil Elyon Regional Council, Giora Zaltz, told Channel 12 news that some of the aircraft that infiltrated from Lebanon are carrying people, and residents need to seek shelter. “This is what we feared, what we were preparing for,” he added.Channel 12 also published a map showing the places where alarms went off, and it shows that hundreds of places along the Lebanon border are considered under threat.The aircraft carrying people could be paragliders, the aircraft used by Hamas terrorists to enter Israel from Gaza during the Saturday attack.However, the Israel Defense Forces said it has not identified any impacts and there are no reports of injuries following drone infiltration alerts that sounded across northern Israel. “IDF forces are scanning the area from the ground and from the air,” the military said.Moreover, long-range rockets fired from Gaza fell in an open area in Haifa, the coastal city in northern Israel. This rocket attack triggered alarms in the city. Video of a drone flying over northern Israel had also appeared, but later it was found to be Israeli.The drone infiltration comes after Hezbollah fired anti-tank missiles at an Israeli military position near the Lebanon border earlier on Wednesday. The Israel Defense Forces said that it responded with a drone strike on a Hezbollah post. Earlier, 15 rockets were launched from Lebanon at the Western Galilee, however, nobody was injured in the attack. IDF has been engaging with Hezbollah on the northern border since the Hamas attack.It is notable that earlier today the US and several other Western powers warned Hezbollah against escalating the Israel-Hamas war.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

84,"11 October, 2023 ",The US and other Western powers warn Lebanon-based Hezbollah against escalating the Israel-Hamas war,"A message has been sent to Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict through a number of channels, including the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah-allied Speaker of Lebanon's Parliament, Nabih Berri.The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has been cautioned by the United States and its allies against escalating the conflict in Israel. This comes after the deployment of US military assets to prevent a potential widening of the war, multiple US officials aware of the matter told CNN.At this point, senior administration officials do not believe that Hezbollah is likely to join Hamas’ war in force against Israel, and officials think the warnings are having an impact even though there has been some escalation on the border.A message has been sent to Hezbollah to stay out of the conflict through a number of channels, including the Lebanese government and the Hezbollah-allied Speaker of Lebanon’s Parliament, Nabih Berri.Berri was mentioned by administration officials briefing Congress on Sunday as a go-between, according to a person familiar with the briefing. The US won’t officially engage with what has been designated a terrorist group, so Berri is one natural conduit, as per CNN.At Israel’s request, France has also conveyed to Hezbollah that they must stay out of the war and not escalate further or Israel will respond significantly, a source briefed on the talks said. Those discussions were also coordinated with the US, the source said.“Western allies who have informal ties with Hezbollah have conveyed some messages,” a Western diplomat confirmed, adding that the response by Hezbollah indicated “the pre-existing will of Hezbollah not to escalate for now.”A senior defence official said on Monday, “We are deeply concerned about Hezbollah making the wrong decision and choosing to open a second front to this conflict,” adding: “We are working with Israel and with our partners across the region to contain this to Gaza.”Hezbollah is a highly trained, well-armed and sophisticated military force that also receives Iranian support, so its entry into the conflict would mark a significant escalation. But current and former senior officials don’t believe Hezbollah is eager to join the war, largely because the risks for the group would outweigh any potential rewards.Meanwhile, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has ordered the deployment of a carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean in large part as a message to Hezbollah and its Iranian backers to refrain from entering the war.US security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters at the White House on Tuesday: “Let me be clear, we did not move the carrier for Hamas. We moved the carrier to send a clear message of deterrence to other states or non-state actors that might seek to widen this war.”President Joe Biden reinforced that message in remarks on Tuesday from the White House.“Let me say again, to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of the situation, I have one word: Don’t. Don’t. Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear,” he said.US Mission to Israel Charge d’Affaires ad interim Stephanie Hallett was on Wednesday present at the Gaza periphery to bear witness to the atrocities that were committed on Saturday. “We’ve come down here along the Gaza periphery to bear witness to the atrocities that were committed here on Saturday. And it’s really unbelievable, as a mother and just as a human being, to see and to know what happened here is really important, to say that we’ve been here, we’ve seen it, and it is evil. And we stand with Israel. All of us. We stand with Israel.”The IDF earlier said an anti-tank missile was launched from Lebanon towards a military post near the community of Arab Al-Aramshe.Taking to X, the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) stated, “An anti-tank missile was launched from Lebanon toward a military post adjacent to the community of Arab Al-Aramshe on the #BlueLine.”A suspected infiltration attempt occurred near the border town of Rosh HaNikra.A senior Israel Defence Forces (IDF) officer and two soldiers were killed during a firefight with terrorists who infiltrated into Israeli territory from southern Lebanon on Monday afternoon, the military confirmed on Tuesday.Five additional Israeli troops were wounded in the attack, according to the IDF.The officer was identified as 300th Brigade Deputy Commander Lt Col Alim Abdullah, 40, from the Druze village of Yanuh-Jat in northern Israel.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

85,"11 October, 2023 ",Gaza falls into complete darkness as its sole power plant ran out of fuel after Israel stopped supplying electricity,"Israel is the main source of electricity for Gaza, apart from its own diesel-run power plantAs Israeli defence forces continue bombing Hamas sites in the Gaza Strip, the territory experienced a complete power outage after the sole power station in the Palestinian enclave stopped working, Reuters reported, citing Hamas media. The development comes two days after Israel announced that it was going to impose a “total blockade” on Gaza which would include a ban on admitting food and fuel to the area.As Israel had stopped supplying electricity to Gaza due to the horrific terror attack by Hamas, the Gaza Strip was completely dependent on a diesel-powered power plant. However, the plant ran out of fuel as Israel imposed a complete blockade, resulting in a complete loss of electricity for the territory. Israel cut the power supply to Gaza after the Israeli defence minister announced the government’s intention to do so.BREAKING: Gaza ran out of its last fuel reserves and all power sources are down. No more electricity in Gaza.BREAKING: Gaza power plant shuts down after running out of fuelAfter Hamas terrorists launched a rocket attack and ground invasion on 7th October, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced, “There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.” Since then, Gaza has been facing an electricity crisis as Israel stopped the supply of electricity to the region. But now, its only other source of power has also run out of fuel and has reportedly stopped working leaving Gaza with no electricity. Earlier, on 7th October (Saturday), the power authority in Gaza reported an electricity shortage of close to 80 percent. On 9th October (Monday), the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs had estimated that the power plant could soon run out of fuel.Public advocacy director at Gisha, Miriam Marmur said, “Within a matter of days Gaza will be in a blackout.” It is notable that the main source of electricity for Gaza is Israel, apart from its own diesel plant. Two power companies in Israel supply around 120 megawatts of power to Gaza through ten power lines over the fenced border. When the Gaza power plant was working, it often operated at reduced capacity due to its dependence on inefficient diesel fuel. Earlier Egypt also used to supply electricity to Gaza through the border, but it was stopped in 2018.As per an Israeli nonprofit organisation Gisha, the sole power plant in Gaza runs on diesel fuel which has been funded by Qatar in recent years. The plant was purchased from Israel and was transported to Gaza via the strategic Kerem Shalom Crossing. The power supply in Gaza is around 195 megawatts, out of which 120 megawatts of electricity is purchased from Israel which was used to be delivered through direct power lines to the Gaza Strip. Whereas, Gaza’s sole power plant has three turbines which produce energy in the ranges between 65-75 megawatts. Till the time Hamas terrorists attacked Israeli citizens and made ground invasions inside Israeli territory, Gazans were reportedly getting up to 15 hours of electricity per day on average, depending on weather conditions. However, the Israel-Hamas war has entered its fifth day and Gaza’s sole power plant has reportedly run out of power while Israel has already announced a ‘complete blockade’. On account of these developments, the 2.3 million Gazans are facing a complete blackout in the region. On the fifth day of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, Israel asserted that it had regained full control of its border towns that were captured by Hamas terrorists. According to The Times of Israel, the death toll from Hamas terror and ground invasion has passed 1,200. Additionally, over 3,000 people have been injured, and many of them are in critical condition.In its retaliation, IAF has launched mass strikes in Gaza, bombing a large number of Hamas bases. Israel Defense Forces has said that the bodies of 1,500 Hamas terrorists who had invaded Israel through land, sea and aerial routes have been found around southern Israel. Hundreds more have been killed inside Gaza in IDF operations. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

86,"11 October, 2023 ",Israel forms an emergency unity government and a war cabinet amid the crackdown on Hamas terror sites,"The joint statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gantz read, “An agreement has been reached to bring Benny Gantz’s opposition National Unity party into an emergency government amid the war with Hamas in Gaza following days of negotiations.” On 11th October (Wednesday), Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leader Benny Gantz agreed to form an emergency unity government and a war Cabinet amid ‘Operation Swords of Iron’ against Hamas terrorists. The joint statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Gantz read, “An agreement has been reached to bring Benny Gantz’s opposition National Unity party into an emergency government amid the war with Hamas in Gaza following days of negotiations.” According to the agreement, a small war cabinet to direct the war with Hamas will be created, as demanded by Gantz, which will include just Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and Gantz, The Times of Israel reported. Additionally, Former IDF general National Unity MK Gadi Eisenkot along with Minister Ron Dermer will serve as observers in the war cabinet.Taking to X, Economy Minister Nir Barkat wrote, “The State of Israel has a unity government. At a time like this, we must join forces, give support to IDF soldiers, and work as one until there is a complete victory of the State of Israel over its enemy.”יש ממשלת אחדות למדינת ישראל. בשעה כזו עלינו להתאחד, לתת גב לחיילי צה״ל ולפעול כאיש אחד עד לניצחון מוחלט של מדינת ישראל על האויב. בעזרת השם, ביחד ננצח!Additional information about the unity government reveals that throughout the entire war, five members from the National Unity party will join the expanded security cabinet, which operates under every government — Gantz, Eisenkot, MK Gideon Sa’ar, and two others yet to be determined.A position in the war cabinet has been left open for Opposition Leader Yair Lapid. He has reportedly refused to join the government if the far-right Religious Zionism and Otzma Yehudit parties remain in it, as reported by The Times of Israel.However, it has been agreed that no legislation in the Knesset or government resolutions will be advanced during the war that is not related to managing the war.Meanwhile, the Israel-Hamas war has entered its fifth day and Hamas media has reported that its sole power plant has stopped working leaving 2.3 million Gazans to face a complete blackout. Israel has asserted that it has regained full control of its border towns that were captured by Hamas terrorists. According to The Times of Israel, the death toll from Hamas terror and ground invasion has passed 1,200. In its retaliation, IAF has launched mass strikes in Gaza, hitting at least 150 targets overnight. These reportedly included the Homes of the Hamas commander’s father. The Israeli forces have also killed 18 infiltrating gunmen in the past 24 hours. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

87,"11 October, 2023 ","Ex-NewsClick interns, Caravan columnists and anti-Hindu ‘liberals’: Indians of ‘Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo’ who signed the resolution in support of Hamas","Interestingly, several Indians were also among the thousands of signatories of the outrageous letter. Notably, a student group named 'Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo' supported the pro-Palestine resolution, only to backtrack later.On Saturday (7th October), a student union coalition at Harvard University issued a statement blaming Israel for the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. The letter issued by the Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups was co-signed by 33 student groups.Calling Israel an apartheid regime the letter asserted that Israel alone is responsible for the fresh onslaught by the Hamas terrorists. The pro-Palestine letter accused Israel of ‘systematised land seizures’, ‘regular airstrikes’, ‘detentions’ and forced family disappearances. The letter for all the obvious reasons did not mention the atrocities committed by the Hamas terrorists though.“The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years. From systematized land seizures to routine airstrikes, arbitrary detentions to military checkpoints, and enforced family separations to targeted killings, Palestinians have been forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden,” the letter reads.The statement concludes with the pro-Palestine student union coalition calling on the Harvard community to “take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.”The letter sparked a huge outrage with many Harvard alumni condemning the university’s inaction against the said letter. Moreover, several corporate heads also announced that they would not hire anyone of those who supported Hamas which is inflicting atrocities on innocent Israeli civilians.Interestingly, several Indians were also among the thousands of signatories of the outrageous letter. Notably, a student group named Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo supported the pro-Palestine resolution only to backtrack later. It is notable that this organisation is a part of Harvard’s South Asian Art (SAA). As per the information available on SAA’s website, Arjun Prasad is the co-president of SAA along with Farib Mahmud while Siona Prasad and Nikhil Dharmaraj are SAA’s cultural chair.Interestingly, the Board of members of the SAA had supported the infamous Hinduphobic SB403 Bill alongside Thenmozhi Soundararajan, Executive Director of Equality Labs, the dubious organisation that supported the bill. The contentious bill was recently returned by the governor of California Gavin Newsom who found the bill unnecessary since the existing law already prohibits discrimination based on caste, color, religion and other similar lines.In the media section of the SAA’s website, a screenshot of a video conference held by the SAA board members including Nikhil Dharmaraj and Siona Prasad along with Equality Labs’s Thenmozhi Soundararajan titled “Caste 101: Fighting Caste Discrimination in CS/Tech.As reported earlier the bill was tabled by Senator Aisha Wahhab and passed by the state assembly on 29th August this year, however, it could not become a law with the governor’s veto. The bill was completely based on the Cisco caste case that fell flat in January 2023. Despite the main case on which Aisha Wahab and Equality Labs based the bill was no longer effective in the court, the California State Assembly moved forward and passed the bill.SAA’s Nikhil Dharmaraj in May this year wrote a piece for far-left propaganda magazine The Caravan titled: “The dangers of facial-recognition technology in Indian policing”. The article not surprisingly was blatantly Hinduphobic. Nikhil Dharmaraj in his propaganda piece also blamed Hindus/Hindu mob for the 2020 anti-Hindu Delhi riots.The “saree-loving” Nikhil Dharmaraj in an X post regarding the said article did not forget to bring in Brahminical genealogies even in subjects like AI and face recognition technology.Humbled to share this piece today covering the insidious Brahminical and colonial genealogies of AI surveillance and facial recognition tech in Hindutva India (a short-form version of my senior thesis)—read below / DM me re any access issues ⬇️ https://t.co/DoId3fhGQPNotably, Dharmaraj over the years has been a hater of Israel. As reported by Canary Mission, Dharmaraj was also a member of Harvard University’s Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC) in 2020, 2022, and 2023. It is rather ironic to see a queer supporting Islamic terrorist organisation like Hamas when Islamists openly despise queers.Moreover, Nikhil Dharmaraj and the abovementioned SAA board members are a part of South Asians for Forward-Thinking Advocacy and Research (SAFAR) which has been a pro-Palestine and pro-Kashmir ‘freedom’ organisation known for its disdain towards India and Israel.As highlighted by an X user who goes by the name “Sensei Kraken Zero”, one of the signatories of the anti-Israel Harvard student union statement, Sravya Tadepalli is on the board of directors of a dubious organisation named Hindus for Human Rights. Sravya Tadepalli, who signed off on the Harvard Students Union letter in support of Hamas/Palestine and blaming Israel for the terror attack, is also on the Board of Directors of the Anti-Hindu organisation ""Hindus For Human Rights"" (HFHR).HFHR brands Hindutva as a fascist… pic.twitter.com/a4e3736C5LIndians/people of Indian origin who signed off on the disgusting Harvard statement in support of Palestine/Hamas and against Israel:Shivani Gupta, Sravya Tadepalli, Jasleen Kaur and Sraddha Joshi pic.twitter.com/PG8yWwcpTvIt is worth noting that HFHR co-founded by Sunita Vishwanath is notorious for its pathological hatred for Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is the same organisation that endorsed the infamous ‘Dismantling Global Hindutva’ event. To no surprise, the HFHR also has links to the controversial financier and ‘regime change specialist’ George Soros.There is one thing in common about most of the Indian signatories of the outrageous statement against their hatred for PM Modi and India’s “right wing”. Shraddha Joshi, another Harvard alumni to sign the said statement has been a Modi hater as evidenced by her article titled: “Modi’s Visit to the US Whitewashes India’s Far-Right Violence” published in The Nation magazine in June this year as PM Modi was on a historic state visit to the United States. “Ever since Modi took power in 2014 as the leader of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), India has experienced what is widely described as democratic backsliding, characterized by anti-minority and caste-based violence along with brutal crackdowns on dissent,” the article reads.Interestingly, Joshi has also been an intern at propaganda portal NewsClick which is currently under investigation over receiving funds from China for peddling pro-China propaganda. The portal is accused of flouting the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) rules. Shraddha Joshi is also a supporter of Urban Naxal and ‘journalist’ Gautam Navlakha.It is worth recalling that Gautam Navlakha was arrested in 2020 when 11 people were taken into custody for organizing and giving provocative speeches during the Elgar Parishad event on the 31st of December 2017. The event was organized by “activists” of Kabir Kala Manch in Pune. The NIA says that the event promoted enmity between different groups of people and caste groups, leading to violence and loss of life. The NIA investigation revealed that the organizers of Elgar Parishad were in touch with leaders of CPI (Maoist), a banned terror outfit under UAPA, and were spreading the ideology of Naxalism/Maoism to encourage unlawful activity.As per a Canary Mission report, Shraddha Joshi was an organiser at Harvard Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC). Joshi has also been involved in furthering anti-Israel propaganda. Being a typical hypocrite, Joshi has been actively involved in downplaying the violence committed by the Palestinian side against Israel while blaming Israel for the conflict between the two countries over the years.The terrorist organisation Hamas launched a devastating terror strike on Israeli soil on 7th October. Over 900 people were killed in the attack. Paragliders and vehicle-borne Hamas terrorists brandishing automatic weapons stormed the border fences, attacking civilians, residential communities, and even a music festival in Southern Israel. In retaliation to the brutal terrorist attack,  Israel declared war on Hamas and has been bombarding the Gaza Strip with bombs for three days. Hundreds of Israelis and other nationals have been reported to have been kidnapped by Hamas. Despite the fact that Hamas is holding innocent Israeli people hostage, killing children and families, and raping women, the student unions of Harvard extended support to Hamas and blamed Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

88,"11 October, 2023 ","They will shoot you, you will die: Turkish minister threatens Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu following Israel’s retaliation to Hamas terror attack","After Benjamin Netanyahu posted a video showing IDF bombing Hamas sites in Gaza, Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that Hamas will kill himAs Israel launched a massive retaliatory action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Hamas terror attack on Israel on Saturday, several Muslim nations have expressed their support for Hamas. A minister in Turkey has gone ahead in this aspect, who warned Israeli PM Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Hamas will kill him.Nazif Yilmaz who is the Deputy Minister of National Education of Turkey threatened Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with death on X (Twitter). Referring to the Hamas terrorists, he wrote, “One day they will shoot you too. You will die.” Nazif Yilmaz posted this in reaction to a post uploaded by Netanyahu which portrayed Israel’s military retaliation to the recent gruesome attack on the Jewish nation. Netanyahu posted a video showing Israeli forces bombing Hamas sites in Gaza, with the caption ‘continue with all the strength’.The Turkish minister however later deleted the tweet.Notably, the Eurasian country is a major part of the powerful North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) alliance headed by the United States. The comment received backlash from social media users who reminded the politician of the horrifying terror attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists. A netizen asked him what response he expected after the assailants massacred kids and added that Hamas “knowingly sacrificed their own when they committed acts of terror.” WHAT DID YOU EXPECT???? THEY SLAUGHTERED KIDS AT A MUSIC FESTIVAL!!! HAMAS KNEW THIS WOULD BE THE RESPONSE. THEY!! THEY!! THEY!! KNOWINGLY SACRIFICED THEIR OWN WHEN THEY COMMITTED THESE ACTS OF TERROR.Another asked the minister about his opinion on the atrocities inflicted by the Hamas terrorists on the morning of 7 October. What do you have to say about the people Hamas killed Saturday morning when they invaded Israel?A user told him to go to the Israel border and not make empty threats on the platform. What do you have to say about the people Hamas killed Saturday morning when they invaded Israel?An individual remarked, “Take a look at the deputy minister of national education of the republic. Notice his tone. The war between the two countries does not concern the ministry of national education nor it was provoked by the social media account. You don’t care what we think in private. Do not confuse your ministry. Be accountable.”Cumhuriyetin milli eğitim bakan yardımcısına bak . Üsluba bak. İki ülke arasında yaşanan savaş ne milli eğitim bakanlığını ilgilendirir ne onun makamının sosyal medya hesabından provakasyon yapılır. Özelde ne düşündüğümüz umurunuzda değil . Bakanlığı Hesabınızda karıştırmayın.!A netizen posted an image featuring multiple soft toys for children with ’40 babies murdered’ scrawled in bold letters on top. pic.twitter.com/jRuMaoMqJrArmed Hamas terrorists stormed Israel during the attack on 7 October where they ransacked homes, rampaged through farms along with neighbourhoods and took up hundreds of hostages back to Gaza in addition to slaughtering at least 1,200 people and injuring thousands more including women, children and elderly. Since Israel began airstrikes on the Palestinian enclave at least 1,000 people have died in Gaza and many more are injured.It is important to note that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is known for his proximity with the Islamist elements as well as providing monetary support to religious seminars in India to radicalise Muslims and taking them on a full-expense covered trip to his country for further indoctrination. He has repeatedly supported Pakistan on the Kashmir issue and never condemned the terrorism carried out by the southsian country. Turkey has been found guilty of funding anti-India activities along with Pakistan including the anti-CAA protests and radical preacher Zakir Naik.

89,"11 October, 2023 ",‘It felt like we were playing in Rawalpindi’: Muhammad Rizwan reacts to support Pakistan team received in WC match in Hyderabad,"During the post-match event, Rizwan said, ""I felt like I was playing a match in Pindi. The way the crowd gave love today, and not just for me, but for the whole Pakistan team, they gave love."" On 10th October (Tuesday), Pakistani wicket-keeping batsman Muhammad Rizwan addressed a post-match press conference. He claimed that their game against Sri Lanka in Hyderabad felt like it was some sort of a home game. He argued that the strong support of the Hyderabad crowd made him feel as if they were playing in Lahore, Karachi, or Rawalpindi. During the post-match event, Rizwan said, “I felt like I was playing a match in Pindi. The way the crowd gave love today, and not just for me, but for the whole Pakistan team, they gave love.” One sports journalist inquired about his health as during the match he displayed signs of facing cramps. He noted that even they were feeling pained to see him like that and went on to claim that he played like a mujahid. He also inquired about Pakistan’s 15-day stay in Hyderabad. It is worth noting that during the presentation ceremony when he was asked about cramps, Rizwan said, “Sometimes it is cramps, sometimes it is acting.” Haha 😂 sometimes cramp sometimes acting ..Some likes for funny rizwan.#SLvsPAK pic.twitter.com/9ajiuglObLTo which, Rizwan made this observation underscoring that support from the Hyderabad crowd made them feel like a home game. However, he also claimed that they were glad to see that the Hyderabadi crowd lauded good cricket as they also supported Sri Lankan cricketers. Regarding Hyderabad’s hospitality during their 15-day stay, Rizwan expressed, “Hospitality, you all must have seen it. Someone must have taken pictures when we came to the airport. You must have seen it. What you guys didn’t see, the way these guys welcomed us at the airport, was awesome. The way the crowd came, everyone saw it today, the way they gave their voices with love, I said earlier that I felt like I was playing in front of the crowd of Rawalpindi, our ground in Lahore is big, a lot of people come there, this ground felt like Rawalpindi. Today it seems that Pakistan’s match is taking place in Rawalpindi.” Another sports journalist inquired about the specific aspects of Rizwan’s cricketing skills that he has focused on to enhance his performance over the years. In his response, he thanked the team management for moving him upward on the batting order. He, however, added that he had the required skillset from the start and had done nothing special except hard work which Allah demanded from him. He added that Allah is Rabbul Alamin and it is by grace that luck favoured him as with that even a thick edge could land in the empty ground. Meanwhile, loud chants of “Jeetega bhai Jeetega, Pakistan jeetega” engulfed the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Tuesday evening during the Pakistan vs Sri Lanka match of the World Cup 2023. Several social media users took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to express their shock over the support Pakistan was receiving in its match against Sri Lanka.“Loud chants of “Jeetega bhai jeetega, Pakistan jeetega” in Hyderabad stadium. They did not start organically but the DJ said “jeetega bhai jeetega” & left it to the crowd to finish the famous chant,” said one of the X users, while sharing a video of the same.Loud chants of ""Jeetega bhai jeetega, Pakistan jeetega"" in Hyderabad stadium.They did not start organically but DJ said ""jeetega bhai jeetega"" & left it to the crowd to finish the famous chant.The chant went on for close to a minute due to the DJ.#PAKvsSL #CWC23 #Hyderabad pic.twitter.com/f5l54qmtsVA day after the match in which he scored a man-winning innings of unbeaten 131 runs, Muhammad Rizwan dedicated Pakistan’s win to “brothers and sisters in Gaza.” Taking to X, he also thanked the Indian audience and added, “Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.” However, the cricketer received a lot of flak for interjecting politics into the game.This was for our brothers and sisters in Gaza. 🤲🏼Happy to contribute in the win. Credits to the whole team and especially Abdullah Shafique and Hassan Ali for making it easier.Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.Rizwan’s tweet appeared to be in violation of the code of conduct drawn up by the ICC, which has strict rules for cricketers indulging in making political and religious statements. In fact, in World Cup 2019, the ICC had objected to something as benign as wearing wicket-keeping gloves with Indian Army insignia and had asked former Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to remove them.“The ICC has responded to the BCCI to confirm the logo displayed by MS Dhoni in the previous match is not permitted to be worn on his wicket-keeping gloves at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019,” the ICC statement issued in 2019 read. Similarly, in 2014, the ICC banned English cricketer Moeen Ali from wearing “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine” wristbands while playing for England. The BCCI should also take note of Rizwan’s comment and ensure that foreign cricketers who have come to India for the 2023 World Cup don’t end up exploiting the cricketing platform to peddle individual agendas and express sympathy for terrorists who killed hundreds of civilians in Israel. The Indian government should also step in and convey to the Pakistan Cricket Board that their cricketers must refrain from politicising the sport while being in India for an ICC event. Rizwan should be made to apologise for politicising the World Cup and asked to pull down his post.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

90,"11 October, 2023 ","Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar","During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands.

91,"11 October, 2023 ",‘Outside the field of play’: ICC refuses to act against Muhammad Rizwan over his tweet dedicating WC match win to Gaza residents,"Aaj Tak journalist Vikrant Gupta took to X, a social media platform earlier known as Twitter, to inform that ICC has refused to take action against Muhammad Rizwan.The International Cricket Council, ICC, has reportedly refused to take action against Pakistan cricketer Muhammad Rizwan over his tweet dedicating the team’s win over Sri Lanka in the World Cup to the Gaza residents. Claiming that it is outside the field of play and not within their domain, the ICC added it is up to the individual and the cricket board to act on the situation. Aaj Tak journalist Vikrant Gupta took to X, a social media platform earlier known as Twitter, to inform that ICC has refused to take action against Muhammad Rizwan.The @ICC says it’s from outside the field of play, not within their domain. Up to the individual and his cricket board https://t.co/5nc5Fai8eXEarlier today, Pakistani cricketer Muhammad Rizwan, known for unabashedly demonstrating his religiosity on and off the field, stirred a hornet’s nest after he dedicated the victory over Sri Lanka to Gaza residents. His posts quickly went viral, triggering sharp reactions from several quarters on X, formerly known as Twitter, with many social media users asking for the BCCI and ICC to act against the cricketer for expressing solidarity with the people after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Israelis, including elderly, women, and children.While the ICC had tried to wash its hand off the issue by claiming that it is outside the field of play, it is worth noting that Muhammad Rizwan is infamous for fusing politics, religion and sports much like several of his countrymen. He recently caught the attention of many when he started offering Namaz on the cricket field during the second half of the match against the Netherlands while his teammates awaited drinks during the break. Earlier in 2021, Rizwan had offered namaz on the ground. When Babar Azam-led side defeated India by 10 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup ‘Super 12’ game, former Pakistan pace bowler Waqar Younis expressed his glee and voiced, “What I liked most is what Rizwan did. He stood in the middle of the ground and read the prayers in front of the Hindus,” after the 31-year-old Muhammad Rizwan had used the cricket match as an opportunity to flaunt his faith in front of millions of viewers.A surprise attack deemed ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ by Hamas on Israel which combined gunmen raiding Israeli border villages with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza was launched at dawn on 7 October during the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah which resulted in the gruesome murder of at least 1000 people including children and elderly while more than 2,000 were wounded. The terrorists also raped women and abducted hundreds in one of the deadliest attacks in history. Israel then launched ‘Operation Iron Swords’ in retaliation and invoked Article 40 for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and officially declared war.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

93,"11 October, 2023 ",New Delhi: Nozzles worth lakhs of rupees stolen from fountains installed for G20 Summit at Bharat Mandapam,"According to officials of the Public Works Department, the stainless steel nozzles are priced at Rs 4,000 eachNozzles worth lakhs of rupees have been stolen from the fountains which were installed outside Bharat Mandapam and the Delhi Gate for the G20 Summit. After the conclusion of the Summit, the agency appointed for the maintenance of the fountains noticed the theft and filed a police complaint.According to officials of the Public Works Department, the stainless steel nozzles are priced at Rs 4,000 each. A number of fountains were installed across the central Delhi area in the run-up to the G20 Summit.A PWD official reportedly said, “Twenty-four nozzles have been stolen from fountains outside the Bharat Mandapam while 12 nozzles from the fountain at Delhi Gate. The theft happened after the culmination of the G20 Summit.”When asked whether the CCTV cameras installed in the areas captured any suspicious movement, the official said that the cameras installed by the agency cover only Gates 6 and 7 of Bharat Mandapam.“There are also cameras installed by the Delhi Police but we do not know whether they are functional. The nozzles are expensive and we are trying to find alternatives to them,” the official said.He added that while the PWD replaced the stolen nozzles with plastic ones at the Delhi Gate, the nozzles outside Bharat Mandapam could only be fitted with stainless steel because of the large size of the fountains.Mere 10-15 days after the G20 Summit concluded, incidents of thefts and damage to items installed around Bharat Mandapam reportedly increased. The police said they have received several complaints of missing flower pots, rubber nozzles, wires, and broken lights in the national capital.In February too, months ahead of the G20 Summit, a video went viral showing a VIP resident from Gurgaon stealing several flower pots and carrying them in his high-end vehicle.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

95,"11 October, 2023 ",How Hamas hides behind civilians to peddle victimhood: Gaza’s biggest hospital Al Shifa also served as HQ for terrorists,"The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (MAITIC) has alleged that Hamas and other terrorist organisations ""have frequently made use of hospitals and other medical facilities for various military purposes"".Israel has been bombing Gaza in a retaliation to the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October. Several hospitals have been reduced to rubble. Al Shifa, Gaza’s largest hospital, has also sustained damage including to the neonatal unit as Israel targets “Jihadi” infrastructure in Gaza. Here’s why Hamas is responsible for the same. Amid the treated images of debris and dust that Gaza has become, the Al Shifa hospital, albeit partially damaged, stands as a reminder of the terrorism that has been unleashed historically from the contested land.The Al Shifa Hospital has been the headquarters for Hamas terrorists. The Washington Post in 2014 reported that Al Shifa Hopital had become the “de facto headquarters for Hamas leaders who can be seen in the hallways and offices”.In 2014, when Israel and Palestine agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt, a protester from a mosque opposite to the Al Shifa hospital blared on a loudspeaker calling the then-Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and his administration “traitors” and “collaborators”.Crowds had gathered at the hospital in July 2014 throwing shoes and eggs at the health minister who was turned away before he reached the hospital. The Al Shifa hospital is just one among the several civilian structures that have regularly been used by Hamas to launch attacks at Israel.According to a report by Tablet dated 2014, one of Hamas’ main command bunkers was located beneath Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The bunker was equipped with sophisticated communications equipment and housed a part of the Hamas leadership.The report claimed that in 2006, PBS aired a documentary showing how gunmen roamed the halls of the Al Shifa Hospital, intimidated the staff, and denied them access to protected locations within the building where the camera crew was prohibited from filming.A reporter from the Finnish Helsingin Sanomat TV had also confirmed during her reporting of the 2014 war that Hamas had been firing rockets out of the Al Shifa Hospital. It was reported that a rocket was launched “right in the back of the parking lot of the hospital”.According to a 2014 report by The Times of Israel, “The Wall Street Journal‘s Middle East correspondent, Nick Casey, wrote on Twitter that Hamas uses Shifa “as a safe place to see media,” but removed the post afterwards”.The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center (MAITIC) has alleged that Hamas and other terrorist organisations “have frequently made use of hospitals and other medical facilities for various military purposes”.It revealed that Hamas used ambulances to move terrorists and weapons. The modus operandi, according to MAITIC, has been used by Hamas during several Israeli operations including Operation Protective Edge and Operation Cast Lead.During Operation Cast Lead, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades – which were established in 1991 to provide Hamas with military capability – located themselves at the Al Shifa Hospital closing off some of its wings.According to MAITIC, in 2014, the Israeli Defense Forces identified two Palestinian terrorists using ambulances to move through the Gaza Strip. The driver was reportedly wearing a white coat. The IDF did not attack the ambulance.A video of the same was shared by the IDF on YouTube. Moreover, terrorists established positions near the hospital to launch mortar shells. Evidence collected by the IDF and Israeli intelligence has revealed the following:“Senior Hamas and Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades figures hid in the hospital during Operation Cast Lead. They closed off some of the departments, stationed armed guards and closely examined everyone in the hospital. Hamas transferred weapons from buildings close to the hospital. The teaching and training area of the hospital next to the new delivery room was used as living quarters by Hamas operatives. A tunnel was dug under a mosque near the hospital, which served as a direct escape route from one to the other. A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with Israel was executed in the hospital.”In September 2014, Hamas itself confessed to have used residential and civilian areas to launch an offensive against Israel. It also admitted to have used human shields to fire rockets into Israel.Images accessed from the IDF and published by The Daily Mail showed Hamas using four rocket launch sites next to a cluster of schools and residences.In 2021, after another escalated conflict with Hamas, Israel bombed the Al Jalaa building in Gaza, which contained the offices of several media organisations. Shortly after issuing a warning, Israel had bombed the Al Jalaa building that housed Al Jazeera and other international media outlets in Gaza city citing the presence of terror organisation Hamas’ military intelligence office in the high-rise.In the recent conflict too, Israel has been repeatedly sharing evidence of how Hamas locates its weapon silos, and intelligence units close to schools and residential areas, creating a ‘shield’ around itself at the cost of civilian lives. Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzIsrael has been pounding Gaza with hundreds of airstrikes. Meanwhile, the country is preparing for an all-out ground offensive on Gaza.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

96,"11 October, 2023 ","Muhammad Rizwan dedicates WC match win to Gaza residents: Why ICC, BCCI must take stern action against the Pakistani cricketer","Rizwan's tweet was in brazen violation of the code of conduct drawn up by the ICC, which has strict rules for cricketers indulging in making political and religious statements. In fact, in World Cup 2019, the ICC had objected to something as benign as wearing wicket-keeping gloves with Indian Army insignia and had asked former Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to remove them. Pakistan played Sri Lanka on 10 October in the ongoing World Cup 2023 which ended in Pakistan’s victory. Now, Muhammad Rizwan who managed to score a century in the match has dedicated his country’s win to “brothers and sisters in Gaza.” He also thanked the Indian audience and added, “Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.”This was for our brothers and sisters in Gaza. 🤲🏼Happy to contribute in the win. Credits to the whole team and especially Abdullah Shafique and Hassan Ali for making it easier.Extremely grateful to the people of Hyderabad for the amazing hospitality and support throughout.However, the cricketer received a lot of flak for interjecting politics into the game. The Skin Doctor questioned how his runs or Pakistan’s triumph would help the residents of Gaza. He advised the player and his team to donate all of their earnings, including match fees, prizes and endorsements in order to make an actual contribution to the Palestinian cause.How will a century or a win help them in Gaza? Instead, you and entire Pak team should donate all kinds of earnings, whether it's match fees, awards, endorsements, etc., from the World Cup to Palestinians. That would be genuine assistance. Otherwise this tweet is just hogwash.“He should go to fight against Israel. What on earth is he doing here playing cricket,” commented a social media user. Isko to jaake Israel ke against ladna chahiye yaha cricket khel Raha yeAnother user brought up the barbarity of Hamas terrorists whom he called the batsman’s brothers and wrote that even ten more centuries won’t match up to the crimes committed by the former. He also attached two images highlighting the brutality of the Hamas terrorists, particularly on the elderly, women and children. Score 10 more centuries at least.. even that won't do full justice to such 👇🏽 achievements by your palestinian hamas terrorist brothers.. pic.twitter.com/uwKTnaxKzNA user referred to the poor economic condition of the people of Pakistan and mentioned that they can only offer verbal support and can not “even donate match fees and winning cash.”Pakistani’s can do this only, cant even donate match fees and winning cash.Khud ki halat bhikari jaise ho rakhi haiA netizen demanded the immediate return of the Pakistan Cricket Team to Pakistan and asked the International Cricket Council to prevent the international event from turning into a “tool for supporting Hamas Terrorists.”Pakistan Cricket Team should be sent back to Pakistan asap.@ICC should not allow Cricket World Cup to become a tool for supporting Hamas Terrorists.A user called him out for his silence at the heinous murder of thousands of Israelis and added, “Shame on you for this tweet.”You didn’t utter a single word when Israel was attacked and so many lost their lives?? Shame on you for this tweet.Rizwan’s tweet appeared to be in violation of the code of conduct drawn up by the ICC, which has strict rules for cricketers indulging in making political and religious statements. In fact, in World Cup 2019, the ICC had objected to something as benign as wearing wicket-keeping gloves with Indian Army insignia and had asked former Indian wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni to remove them. “The ICC has responded to the BCCI to confirm the logo displayed by MS Dhoni in the previous match is not permitted to be worn on his wicket-keeping gloves at the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2019,” the ICC statement issued in 2019 read.In 2014, the ICC banned English cricketer Moeen Ali from wearing “Save Gaza” and “Free Palestine” wristbands while playing for England. “The ICC equipment and clothing regulations do not permit the display of messages that relate to political, religious or racial activities or causes during an international match. Moeen Ali was told by the match referee that while he is free to express his views on such causes away from the cricket field, he is not permitted to wear the wristbands on the field of play and warned not to wear the bands again during an international match,” the statement issued by the apex cricketing body said.By the same token, the ICC should also issue a statement expressing its disapproval of Rizwan’s statement supporting Hamas and ask the Pakistan Cricket Board to get its player to recant his tweet that seeks to glorify the egregious terror attacks carried out by Hamas terrorists against Israeli civilians, including elderly, women, and children, many of whom were found dead with their heads chopped off.The BCCI should also take note of Rizwan’s comment and ensure that foreign cricketers who have come to India for the 2023 World Cup don’t end up exploiting the cricketing platform to peddle individual agendas and express sympathy for terrorists who killed hundreds of civilians in Israel. The Indian government should also step in and convey to the Pakistan Cricket Board that their cricketers must refrain from politicising the sport while being in India for an ICC event. Rizwan should be made to apologise for politicising the World Cup and asked to pull down his post. Above everything else, Rizwan’s tweet expressing solidarity with the Hamas terrorists exposes the banal tropes that former Pakistani cricketers and Pakistani journalists resort to while arguing for restoring a bilateral cricketing relationship with India. They keep harping about keeping politics and cricket apart, but the latest post by Rizwan betrays their underlying sentiments: Ummah above everything else. From former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, who had said a cricket match against India to him was jihad, similarly, decades later, for the current crop of Pakistani cricketers too, cricket only seems to be a platform to perpetuate their religious supremacism and “common brotherhood”, which apparently entails sympathising with terrorists.Notably, Muhammad Rizwan is infamous for fusing politics, religion and sports much like several of his countrymen. He recently caught the attention of many when he started offering Namaz on the cricket field during the second half of the match against the Netherlands while his teammates awaited drinks during the break. He received condemnation for doing the same just in front of Indians.#WATCH : Mohammad Rizwan intentionally does this when there are Indians watching him. During T20 World Cup 2021, India vs Pakistan match he has offers ‘Namaz’ in ground during drink break. #MohammadRizwan #Pakistan #PAKvNED #namaz #INDVSPAK #icccricketworldcup2023 #ICCWorldCup pic.twitter.com/a0NAz4JvkZNetizens accused the wicket-keeper batsman of bringing religion into cricket, unlike Indian players who never behave in such a manner. Interestingly, when Babar Azam-led side defeated India by 10 wickets in the ICC T20 World Cup ‘Super 12’ game on 24 October 2021, former Pakistan pace bowler Waqar Younis expressed his glee and voiced, “What I liked most is what Rizwan did. He stood in the middle of the ground and read the prayers in front of the Hindus,” after the 31-year-old Muhammad Rizwan had used the cricket match as an opportunity to flaunt his faith in front of millions of viewers.""Rizwan offered Namaz during #INDvPAK match in middle of Hindus was most satisfying thing Mashallah, even more than his batting""– Waqar Younis & Shoaib Akhtar discusspic.twitter.com/ELTVJSTqh4He was slammed by Indian cricketers and commentators who called out his Jihadi mindset and he was forced to apologise with folded hands. He blamed his bigoted opinion on the “heat of the moment” and claimed that it was a “genuine mistake.” He alleged he did not want to hurt the sentiments of anyone and apologised when the controversy escalated. In the heat of the moment, I said something which I did not mean which has hurt the sentiments of many. I apologise for this, this was not intended at all, genuine mistake. Sports unites people regardless of race, colour or religion. #apologies 🙏🏻Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Cricket World Cup 2023 has not been without its share of contentions. Former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden and Pakistan’s Ramiz Raja took advantage of the platform provided by the occasion and advocated for Islam while providing commentary for a practice match between Australia and Pakistan on 3 October. The two exploited the game as an instrument to spread their own religious views while consciously ignoring the unifying power of sports which irked many social media users. When the ex-chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board questioned Matthew Hayden about his experiences as a former coach of the Pakistani team, he responded that the Islamic way of life instils discipline which he greatly admires and that Pakistani cricket is also very focused on Islam and that it is the main component of their players. The two were lambasted by the public for promoting Islam at a major sporting event who found their discourse offensive.On 9 October, Zainab Abbas Pakistani cricket presenter had to leave India after her anti-Hindu tweets went viral on social media. The netizens asked for her deportation and Supreme Court lawyer Vineet Jindal also filed a cyber complaint against her which eventually resulted in the termination of her contract and she had to exit the country.During the World Cup match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka on 10 October repeated slogans of “Jeetega bhai Jeetega, Pakistan Jeetega” (Pakistan will win) filled the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad and proved the former Pakistani cricketer Mushtaq Ahmed correct who predicted that his country’s team is going to receive humongous support in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad due to their large Muslim population.Cricket which is supposed to be a gentlemen’s game has become a tool of anti-India propaganda in our neighbouring country Pakistan. Whether it is Shahid Afridi or Shoaib Akhtar who repeatedly attacked India over Kashmir or former Prime Minister and ex-Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan who called a cricket match between the two nations ‘a way of Jihad’ against India, the hate against the country and Hindus in particular from Pakistan cricketers has been ever-present and palpable.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

97,"11 October, 2023 ",Greek leftist politician who refuses to condemn Hamas terror attack on Israel ‘warns’ PM Modi against taking action on Arundhati Roy,"Equating the Hamas terrorist attack as rebellion, Greek left-wing politician Varoufakis justified the killing of innocent civilians claiming that rebellion has to take the lives of some innocent people with them.
On 11th October (Wednesday), a day after Delhi LG gave prosecution sanction against ‘activist’ Arundhati Roy, Greek left-wing politician Yanis Varoufakis issued a ‘warning’ to the Indian Prime Minister against taking action on her. Claiming that she is the world’s finest author, Varoufakis wrote on X, “Mr Modi, hands off Arundhati Roy, India’s, and perhaps the world’s, finest author.” He also shared The Guardian article report about the recent action against her in the 2010 provocative speeches case made in New Delhi.  Mr Modi, hands off Arundhati Roy, India's, and perhaps the world's, finest author. https://t.co/iyLbU2kKyzNotably, on 10th October, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena gave sanctions for prosecution against ‘activist’ Arundhati Roy and former Kashmiri professor Sheikh Showkat Hussain in the 2010 provocative speeches case, officials of Raj Niwas (Governor’s House) said. They added that the FIR against Roy and Hussain was lodged after the orders of the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate, New Delhi on 27 November 2010.In a complaint filed by Kashmiri social activist, Sushil Pandit, it was alleged that several individuals delivered provocative speeches in public at a conference under the banner of “Azadi – The Only Way”. The event was organised by the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) on 21st October 2010, at LTG Auditorium, Copernicus Marg, Delhi. The complainant had further alleged that the issue discussed and propagated during that event was the “Separation of Kashmir from India”.Two other accused namely Sayed Ali Shah Geelani, the Kashmiri separatist leader, and Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani, a Delhi University lecturer who was acquitted by the Supreme Court in a Parliament attack case on technical grounds — have died during the pendency of the case. Although the case was also registered under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, the LG had not given sanctions for prosecution against them in this specific section owing to the Supreme Court’s direction to keep all pending trials under Sedition at abeyance.It is worth noting that Greek left-wing politician Yanis Varoufakis has previously served as the Finance Minister between January 2015 and July 2015. In 2016, he co-founded Democracy in Europe Movement 2025 (DiEM25), a pan-European and left-wing political party. Since 2018, he has served as Secretary-General of DiEM25. While speaking to the media about the Hamas terror attack on Israel this Saturday, former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis adamantly said that he and his party will never condemn Hamas’ attack on Israel. In an interview shown on X, he said, “Those who try very hard to extract from people like me and DiEM25 a condemnation of the attack by the Hamas guerillas will never get it.” He ranted, “And they will never get it for a very simple reason. Those who care about humans without any discrimination, those who care equally about a Jew and an Arab, must ask themselves a very simple question: what exactly is their idea of the cessation of hostilities? That Palestinians are going to lay down their arms and go back into the largest open-air prison in the world where they are constantly suffocated by the apartheid state?”Varoufakis went on to compare Hamas with the ANC’s armed wing uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), which also “killed innocent civilians.” Equating the Hamas terrorist attack as rebellion, he justified the killing of innocent civilians claiming that rebellion has to take the lives of some innocent people with them. He lamented, “Any human being living under apartheid at some point will either die a terrible silent death or rebel and take some innocent people with them.

98,"11 October, 2023 ","USA: Harvard students start backtracking from support to Hamas after CEOs indicate they wouldn’t hire them, and University distances itself","Danielle Mikaelian, the former Harvard student group board member who signed the letter, stepped down from her position. In a thread on X, she said that the decision to sign the letter was egregious and apologised for the pain her actions caused.On 11th October, Harvard students who had issued a letter in support of Palestine following a terror attack by the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas against Israeli civilians started backtracking from their condemnation of Israel. The “change of heart” appeared to result from worldwide criticism and the decision of corporate heads, especially Jews, not to hire anyone who expressed support to Hamas’ barbaric acts.Danielle Mikaelian, the former Harvard student group board member who signed the letter, stepped down from her position. In a thread on X, she said that the decision to sign the letter was egregious and apologised for the pain her actions caused. She further claimed that she signed the letter without seeing it. She added, “The statement is not representative of my values, and my heart is with those impacted.”I prevented another student group I remain on the board of from signing on when I saw the statement. The statement is not representative of my values and my heart is with those impacted 💔The Nepalese student organisation, Harvard Undergraduate Nepali Student Association, also backtracked from the statement. In a post on Instagram, they wrote, “We regret that our decision to co-sign the latest PSC statement to call attention to historical injustices against Palestinians, with an earnest desire for peace, has been interpreted as a tacit support for the recent violent attacks in Israel.”A post shared by HUNSA (@_harvardnepal_)They added, “To ensure that our stance on the condemnation of violence by Hamas and support for a just peace remains clear, we retract our signature from the statement. Through this message, we hope to send love, strength, and solidarity as multiple communities worldwide, including us, continue to process the loss of those who have left us too early.”It is notable here that several Nepali citizens have been brutally killed by Hamas in the terror attack in Southern Israel.Harvard Ghungroo, another such organisation, also took back the support for the statement. In an Instagram post, the group wrote, “We, Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo, would like to formally apologise for co-signing the statement made by The Harvard Palestinian Committee and have formally retracted our signature. We would like to clarify that we stand in solidarity with both Israeli and Palestinian victims and families. Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo strictly denounces and condemns the massacre propagated by the terrorist organisation Hamas. We truly apologise for the insensitivity of the statement that was released recently.”A post shared by Harvard Undergraduate Ghungroo (@harvardghungroo)After the backlash, the University President, Claudine Gay, condemned student groups’ statement. She said, “As the events of recent days continue to reverberate, let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas. Such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one’s individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region.Let me also state, on this matter as on others, that while our students have the right to speak for themselves, no student group — not even 30 student groups — speaks for Harvard University or its leadership.""Let there be no doubt that I condemn the terrorist atrocities perpetrated by Hamas. Such inhumanity is abhorrent, whatever one’s individual views of the origins of longstanding conflicts in the region.""

And I appeal to all of us in this community of learning to keep this in mind as our conversations continue.“On 10th October, Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, wrote on X that a number of CEOs asked him if Harvard would release a “list of the members of each of the Harvard organizations that have issued the letter assigning sole responsibility for Hamas’ heinous acts to Israel, so as to ensure that none of us inadvertently hire any of their members.”I have been asked by a number of CEOs if @harvard would release a list of the members of each of the Harvard organizations that have issued the letter assigning sole responsibility for Hamas’ heinous acts to Israel, so as to insure that none of us inadvertently hire any of their… https://t.co/7kzGOAGwp9He added that the signatories’ names should be made public so that the world knows their views. “One should not be able to hide behind a corporate shield when issuing statements supporting the actions of terrorists, who, we now learn, have beheaded babies, among other inconceivably despicable acts,” he added.Winston & Strawn LLP, a New York based Law firm, issued a statement saying that they came to know that a former summer associate published inflammatory comments about Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and distributed it to the NYU Student Bar Association. The firm rescinded the law student’s offer of employment.The letter issued by the Harvard students went viral after a University student Yael Bar Tur shared it on X. In her post, she wrote, “This is the final crack in my broken heart – a joint statement from Harvard students. I could be sitting in class with these students, watching children brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped and their mutated bodies torn apart by a jeering crowd – and hear why it’s justified.”This is the final crack in my broken heart – a joint statement from @Harvard students. I could be sitting in class with these students, watching children brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped and their mutated bodies torn apart by a jeering crowd – and hear why it’s justified. pic.twitter.com/UTi60Y2omJThe latest version of the letter without the list of the groups can be seen here. Instead of the list of the groups and students who signed the letter, it now reads, “This statement was co-authored by a coalition of Palestine solidarity groups at Harvard. For student safety, the names of all original signing organizations have been concealed at this time.“In the letter, the student groups blamed Israel for the Hamas Terrorist Attack. It even justified the Hamas attack and the barbaric slaughter of civilians in Southern Israel that unfolded on 7th October. The letter read, “We, the undersigned student organizations, hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence. Today’s events did not occur in a vacuum. For the last two decades, millions of Palestinians in Gaza have been forced to live in an open-air prison. Israeli officials promise to “open the gates of hell,” and the massacres in Gaza have already commenced. Palestinians in Gaza have no shelters for refuge and nowhere to escape. In the coming days, Palestinians will be forced to bear the full brunt of Israel’s violence. The apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years. From systematized land seizures to routine airstrikes, arbitrary detentions to military checkpoints, and enforced family separations to targeted killings, Palestinians have been forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden. Today, the Palestinian ordeal enters into uncharted territory. The coming days will require a firm stand against colonial retaliation. We call on the Harvard community to take action to stop the ongoing annihilation of Palestinians.“On 7th October (local time), the terrorist organisation Hamas launched a brutal terror attack on Israeli soil. Over 900 people were killed in the attack. Paragliders and vehicle-borne Hamas terrorists wielding automatic weapons barged inside the border walls and attacked civilians, residential communities, and even a music festival in Southern Israel. In response to the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that killed over 900 civilians and wounded over 2,500 others, Israel has declared war on Hamas and has been pounding the Gaza Strip with bombs for 3 days now.The US and other NATO nations have declared support for Israel. Hundreds of Israelis and foreign nationals are believed to have been taken hostage by Hamas. Hamas has massacred civilians brutally after attacking a music festival, and family homes in Southern Israel. Social media posts have surfaced where Hamas terrorists are seen killing children, women, and the elderly. The exact number of hostages is unknown.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

99,"11 October, 2023 ","BLM celebrates paragliding Hamas terrorists who killed hundreds of civilians in Israel, gets slammed on social media","Chairman and Chief Technology Officer of X Elon Musk also reacted to the post and stated, ""Your position is clear.""On 10 October Black Lives Matter expressed solidarity with Palestine on social media amid the ongoing crisis between Israel and Palestine. They published an illustration that portrayed a Hamas assailant landing on the Jewish side while wearing a parachute bearing the Palestinian flag on their official X handle. That is all that is it! pic.twitter.com/7DhTIeJ0ylHowever, the internet community reacted strongly and added details about the background of the horrifying attack in the community notes and criticised the organisation for lending its support to terrorism. A netizen crossed Palestine and wrote Hamas over it as a demonstration of dissent.You mean: pic.twitter.com/UJYUQL4GT0End of wokeness questioned whether the adherents of the movement concur with the position adopted by the group.Question for the people with BLM in bio: Do you stand with this?Seth Dillon labelled Palestine and Black Lives Matter as terrorists.Terrorists stand with terrorists.Chairman and Chief Technology Officer of X Elon Musk also reacted to the post and stated, “Your position is clear.”Your position is clearA user commented that the group is siding with those who are murdering children.So you side with the people beheading babies?Okay then.Noted.Comedian Tim Young called Black Lives Matter “trash” and referred to their action as “disgusting”.This is disgusting. BLM is trash.The organisation posted a similar message on their official Instagram page titled ‘Black Lives Matter grassroots statement in solidarity with the Palestinian people’ as well which also drew a flood of condemnation.It read, “As the world is faced with deep questions about self-determination, as we all desire and pray for a world of peace, we must stand unwaveringly on the side of the oppressed. When people have been subject to decades of apartheid and unimaginable violence, their resistance must not be condemned but understood as a desperate act of self-defence.”The statement highlighted, “Black Lives Matter Grassroots stands in solidarity with our Palestinian family who are currently resisting 57 years of settler colonialism and apartheid.” It alleged that the resistance in Palestine was an effort to bring down the walls of the biggest open-air jail in the world which is an argument often used by extremists and their apologists to justify the violence on Israelis. It drew a comparison with the condition of Black people living in the United States and pointed out that they are in a struggle to abolish militarism and mass incarceration in their communities. “As a radical Black organization grounded in abolitionist ideals, we see clear parallels between Black and Palestinian people.”It further continued, “We, too, understand what it means to be surveilled, dehumanized, property seized, families separated, our people criminalized and slaughtered with impunity, locked up in droves, and when we resist they call us terrorists. We, too, dream of a world where our people may live freely on decolonized land.” The notification desired for the borders, checkpoints, prisons, police and watchlists which it claimed to create fears in the hearts of their people to be eliminated. It hoped for a new world to be erected from their remains that honour those who lost their lives in the fight. However, it did not go into detail about what the conflict included or if the rape and murder of innocents should be denounced and forbidden from being used as a form of resistance.“For lasting peace to come, the entire apartheid system must be dismantled. The war on the Palestinian people must cease.” It urged the government of the United States to cease financing the war right away and instead use the $4 billion that Israel spends on its military every year to repair the harm done by US-backed wars, military air attacks, coups, and destabilising interventions against oppressed people all over the world.A post shared by Black Lives Matter Grassroots (@blmgrassroots)Notably, Black Lives Matter failed to deliver a single sentence opposing the despicable actions of Hamas terrorists and projected Palestinians as the only victims which did not go unnoticed. According to one netizen, this was not how a peaceful two-state solution for both Israel and Palestine could be reached.Another asked if they endorsed the atrocities meted out to women and children.An individual called out the post as “incredibly disrespectful” and stated that the group did not do any research on the matter. She mentioned that Hamas isn’t representative of all the Palestinians and added, “True BLM activists would never condone the murdering of innocent people.”One person remarked that they have supported the Black Lives Movement but now the group is in support of the the barbaric acts of Hamas terrorists on women and children. She called herself human for life and stated, “Whatever you are. Blown away.”Another supporter of the movement came forward and called out the group for drawing equivalences between Palestinian people and the Black Lives Matter Movement. “Do you identify with Hamas or just their supporters protesting their show of ignorance and misinformation,” he inquired. The person further referred to Jews as the “smallest minority group in the world” and accused the organisation of provoking more hate against them.The movement began in July 2013 with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of African American teen Trayvon Martin 17 months earlier in February 2012. The organisation that was established to address the issue of racism towards black people in the United States quickly gained a reputation for looting, violence and other illegal acts.George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed on 25 May 2020 by Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, who knelt on the former’s neck for more than 8 minutes until his body became unresponsive. He was reported to the police by a store owner for attempting to pass a ‘potentially counterfeit bill.’ He was pronounced dead after being brought to the Hennepin County Medical Centre.The tragedy sparked rioting and large-scale protests throughout several American cities led by the Black Lives Matter movement. Minneapolis, the city where George the man met his end experienced the most damage. Rocks were thrown at and damaged police cars. The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to calm the enraged crowd in order to pacify the situation.Windows of unmanned stores were broken. Many stores and boutiques were looted and destroyed by the violent rioters in various parts of the country. A woman protestor of the BLM movement had defecated on an overturned police car. Home goods such as rugs and coffee makers were stolen and stores were set ablaze. The mob also breached security and reached the police precinct in the neighbourhood where George Floyd passed away. The building was set on fire by the unruly mob amidst slogans demanding justice for the victim.Multiple statutes including that of Mahatma Gandhi were defaced. A Black Lives Matter protestor named Christopher Hamner was charged with hate crimes against Asian American women in 2021. In the same year, Black Lives Matter (BLM) co-founder Patrisse Khan-Cullors came under fire for buying a series of properties worth millions, especially a home that cost $1.4 million in a predominantly White neighbourhood.A surprise attack deemed ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Flood’ by Hamas on Israel which combined gunmen breaching security barriers with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza was launched at dawn on 7 October during the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah which resulted in the gruesome murder of at least 1000 people including children and elderly while more than 2000 were wounded. The terrorists also raped women and abducted hundreds in one of the deadliest attacks in history. Israel then launched ‘Operation Iron Swords’ in retaliation and invoked Article 40 for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and officially declared war.

He said that it is revenge for 16 years of cutting Gaza off from the world, Israeli police entering the West Bank and violence in Al Aqsa.Mohammad Deif alias Mohammad Masri was born in 1965 in the Khan Younis area of Gaza. Khan Younis is the same area where Israel is currently bombing terrorist bases. Masri joined Hamas at the age of 25. Prior to that, he was associated with the Muslim Brotherhood.Masri is a graduate who has been involved in the Palestinian fight since college time. He was arrested by Israeli security agencies in 1989. But then after 16 months, he was released.Mohammad Deif was linked to the Qassam Brigade by Yahya Ayash, a Hamas “engineer”.

101,"11 October, 2023 ","‘My daughter is alive in Gaza’: German woman Shani Louk, who was paraded naked by Hamas terrorists, reported ‘alive’ by unconfirmed sources","A family friend said that Shani Louk seriously injured in head and she is in the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia in the Gaza StripThe German woman later identified as Shani Louk, whose lifeless and naked body was paraded and spat on by Hamas terrorists during the attack on Israel on 7 October, could still be ‘alive’, her mother has claimed in another recent video message. In a self-recorded video message published by the Wall Street Journal, her mother, Ricarda Louk, stated that a family friend in the Gaza Strip has told her that her daughter was alive in a Hamas hospital. However, she added that her condition is critical and every minute is important as her daughter had suffered a serious head injury during the Hamas terror attack. Ricarda further pleaded with the German government for assistance in ensuring Shani’s safety. In the video message, Ricarda could be heard saying, “We now have information that Shani is alive but has a serious head injury and is in critical condition. Every minute is critical. And we ask…no, we demand the German government to act quickly,” as per English subtitle provided by WSJ.She further pleaded before the German government and urged them not to raise the argument of jurisdiction and ‘act’ to ensure Shani’s safe return from the Gaza Strip. She urged, “One should not argue about the question of jurisdiction. One must act quickly to get Shani out of the Gaza Strip. This is really my desperate call to the entire country of Germany to help me get my Shani back home healthy.” The family friend added that Shani Louk is in the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip. However, a German news outlet Der Siegel reported that the family friend who told Shani’s family about the message of her survival was not allowed to visit her in the hospital himself. It is notable that earlier Louk’s family had said that they were informed by Louk’s bank that her credit card was used in Gaza, indicating that the Hamas terrorists were robbing her.According to the victim’s social media handle, German citizen Shani Louk is a tattoo artist who was present at the Tribe of Supernova music festival which was taking place close to the Gaza border in southern Israel on 7th October, the ill-fated day when Hamas terrorists launched a massive multi-front surprise terror attack on Israeli citizens. Subsequent to the terror attack, she was captured by the Hamas terrorists, and her lifeless body was paraded through the streets in the back of a pickup truck while Hamas terrorists surrounded the vehicle and chanted religious slogans, ‘Allahu Akbar’, some of them even spat on her naked and battered body. The video of the same was shared by the terrorists which had gone viral on the internet. 🚨‼️ O corpo da mulher morta por terroristas palestinos que foi visto neste vídeo é de Shani Louk, de 30 anos, era uma cidadã alemã que visitava Israel para participar do festival de música pela paz realizado perto da fronteira de Gaza. #Israel #Gazapic.twitter.com/zwqDFsKJOMHamas HAD initially claimed that the lifeless body was of a female Israeli soldier. However, it was later ascertained that the woman being paraded in that video was a German tourist named Shani Louk. Apparently, the tattoo on one of the legs of the woman in that video helped in her identification. Her presence at the music festival which was attacked and the fact that she was not answering phone calls further confirmed that she was a victim of the terror attack.Her cousin Tom Weintraub Louk said, “We knew she was in the party. She didn’t answer.” The Washington Post further reported her saying that Shani’s legs were unnaturally laid out in the back of the truck. Her parents watched the video to confirm it was their daughter. Louk added, “We recognised her by the tattoos, and she has long dreadlocks.” Although her whereabouts and whether she was dead or alive were not confirmed by official channels, the family hoped that she was alive despite initial reports claiming that she had been killed by Hamas terrorists. Despite Hamas themselves claiming that the body was of an Israeli female soldier which proved to be false, Iran has started to float a conspiracy theory that Hamas terrorists didn’t massacre innocent partygoers at the music festival where incidentally Shani Louk was also present which was confirmed by her family members. Instead, pro-Iran and pro-Hamas handles have started to float that they got killed in crossfire. ⚡️Reports that Hamas wasn't targeting civilians at the music festival – The IDF were shooting at Hamas FROM the crowd of civilians. Civilians were caught in the crossfire pic.twitter.com/X8Yra2hzUYAustralian media quoted her first cousin saying, “It is definitely Shani. She was at a music festival for peace. This is a nightmare for our family.” As per reports, Shani had attended the music festival which was the first site of attack by Hamas terrorists. On Saturday morning Hamas attacked a dance party near Kibbutz Urim and other Israeli communities, unconfirmed videos of such music festivals have surfaced online in which Hamas terrorists can be seen in backdrop paragliding.It was later found out that Shani Louk was probably robbed as well. In an interview with the German media outlet Der Speigel, her parents revealed that they had learned via Louk’s bank that her credit card had been used in Gaza.Meanwhile, during the clearance operation, it was revealed that Hamas terrorists turned the Israeli music festival into a massacre from where more than 260 bodies were recovered. The survivors also narrated that women were raped near the dead bodies of their friends and dozens of partygoers were taken to Gaza as hostages by the uniformed Hamas terrorists. On 11th October, the Israel-Hamas war entered the fifth day with the death toll crossing 3000 from both sides with the majority of the casualties suffered by Israel.

102,"11 October, 2023 ","The New York Times publishes a report calling Hamas ‘terrorists’, changes to ‘gunmen’ after some time","There is no mention in the NYT report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel's air defence system Iron Dome.On Tuesday (10th October) The New York Times published a news regarding the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

This is Left Media! pic.twitter.com/SBduohHT95Syzmon Thomas posted, “Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt. I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

103,"11 October, 2023 ","‘Yes, I am in favour of wiping out Jews’: Watch old video of Muslim student from University of California proudly supporting Hezbollah","The video holds importance because student groups of Harvard University issued a joint statement in solidarity with Palestinians, although Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel, killing around 1,000 people. As the Israel-Hamas war is approaching its peak, a video from 2010 has gone viral in which a Muslim student who identified herself as Jumanah Imad Albahri at the University of California in San Diego expressed her support for the Lebanese Shia Islamist terrorist organisation Hezbollah’s leader’s hostile intentions towards Jews.Time to resurface this harrowing exchange between David Horowitz and a student at the University of California San Diego in 2010. pic.twitter.com/YPnqKJCzMoThe Muslim student tried to get David Horowitz’s views on Muslim Student Associations (MSAs) in Universities. Horowitz is an American conservative writer and activist who founded the right-wing David Horowitz Freedom Center. He is the editor of FrontPage Magazine and director of Discover the Networks, which tracks individuals and groups affiliated with political left ideology.The MSA was founded in January 1963 at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, to “spread Islam as disciples in North America”. ​​In 2004, an FBI investigation uncovered a Muslim Brotherhood internal paper a Brotherhood leader identified the MSA as “one of our organizations.” MSA reportedly has “almost 600 chapters” in the United States and Canada and is “the most visible and influential Muslim student organization in North America,” with conferences, special events, publications, websites and other activities in this regard The organization has former case officials with clear links to terrorist groups. Al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki (Colorado State University), Somali al-Shabaab militant leader Omar Shafiq Hammami (University of South Alabama), and MSA’s Washington, D.C., mission.In a conversation with Horowitz, the Muslim female student was evasive about her stance on condemning the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas. When Horowitz asked if she would denounce the organisation, she hesitated and expressed concerns that her reply would put her in the way of potential legal consequences and a negative public image.However, Horowitz remained persistent in his line of questioning and expressed his concerns over the student’s failure to condemn Hamas, implying she supported the terrorist organisation. Towards the end, when Hotowitz again asked her if she would condemn Hezbollah’s leader’s hostile intentions towards Jews or if she was “for” such intentions, the student said, “for it”.The 13-year-old video went viral on social media when Hamas attacked Israel unprovoked and killed almost 1,000 Israelis, including children, women, and elders. In retaliation, Israel declared war against Hamas, intending to wipe it from Gaza completely. As Israel launched the counterattack, Islamists and leftists worldwide have come out in support of Hamas and Palestinians.The video holds importance because student groups of Harvard University issued a joint statement in solidarity with Palestinians, although Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel, killing around 1,000 people. Blaming Israel for the situation, the student organisations blamed the Jewish country for taking away land, launching air strikes and doing target killings of Palestinians. They wrote, “Palestinians have been forced to live in a state of death, both slow and sudden”. Following the uproar against the support by the student organisation, the President of the University condemned the attack, and some of the organisations retracted their names from the statement.Furthermore, students of Aligarh University in India also conducted a march to support Palestine and are now facing police FIR for the same. Left organisations are famous for supporting Islamic propaganda in universities worldwide. How can one forget events organised by left-backed student groups in Universities in India in support of terrorists like Afzal Guru? The slogans like “Bharat Tere Tukde Honge Insha Allah” are often raised by these organisations. Universities like AMU, Jamia Milia Islamia and others are often criticised for allowing anti-Hindu and anti-India events. Recently, Jamia students blamed Hindus for Nuh violence despite Islamists mercilessly attacking Hindu devotees in a planned manner. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
